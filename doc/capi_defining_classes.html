@title Defining classes

<p>C modules may define classes and their members using a variety of macros
described in this section and the following sections.
<p>All named members are public by default. Section
@href{Private definitions} describes how to define private members.

@h2 Basics

<p>A class definition starts with the macro A_CLASS (or one of its variants),
and ends with A_END_CLASS(). The structure of the class, including its members
and inheritance relationships, is defined within these macros using the macros
described later in this section and in the following sections.

@fun A_CLASS(name)
@desc Define a C class with the given name. The definition of the class follows
      this macro, and is terminated with the A_END_CLASS macro. Class
      definitions cannot be nested.
@end

@fun A_CLASS_PRIV(name, numPrivate)
@desc This behaves like the A_CLASS macro described above, but also define
      numPrivate unnamed slots for private variables. These slots can be
      accessed only by using @ref{AMemberDirect} and @ref{ASetMemberDirect}.
@end

@fun A_END_CLASS()
@desc Mark the end of a class definition.
@end

@h2 Implementing methods

<p>The type signature of the C function that implements a method in a class
is the same as in a C function that implements and ordinary function, i.e.
AValue &lt;func&gt;(AThread *, AValue *). The structure of the frame is
also similar, but there is an additional self argument at index 0, and
all other values in the frame are displaced by one item:

@example
  frame[0]: self
  frame[1]: Arg 1 (first argument, may be ADefault if optional and not provided by the caller)
  frame[2]: Arg 2 (second argument, may be ADefault if optional and not provided by the caller)
  ...
  frame[n]: Arg n (last argument, may be ADefault if optional not provided by the caller)
  frame[n+1]: VarArgs (optionally an Array containing the rest of the arguments)
  frame[n+2]: Temp 1 (first temporary location)
  ...
  frame[n+m+1]: Temp m (last temporary location)
@end

<p>There are more details available in section
@ref{Implementing C functions} that deals with global functions, but remember
that methods have the additional implicit self argument.

@h2 Defining methods

<p>Method definition macros are mostly identical to function definition macros,
but the frames of the C functions will have the self argument as an additional
item at the start of the frame.

@fun A_METHOD(name, numArgs, numTemps, cFunc)
@desc Define a method with a fixed number of arguments. This macro is used
      like @ref{A_DEF}, but an additional self argument is stored at the
      start of the frame as described above. The self argument is not included
      in the number of arguments, i.e. numArgs only refers to visible
      arguments.
@end

@fun A_METHOD_OPT(name, minArgs, maxArgs, numTemps, cFunc)
@desc Define a method with optional arguments. This is similar to
      @ref{A_DEF_OPT}, except for the implicit self argument.
@end

@fun A_METHOD_VARARG(name, minArgs, maxOrdinary, numTemps, cFunc)
@desc Define a method with an arbitrary number of arguments. This is similar to
      @ref{A_DEF_VARARG}, except for the implicit self argument.
@end

<h3>The create method</h3>

<p>You can define a create method that is called during object construction
in a C class, but unlike a create method implemented in Alore (that does not
return a value), a C create method must always return self, i.e. frame[0],
unless an uncaught exception was raised.

<p>The create method must be used to initialize all member variables and
constants defined in a C class since member initialization expressions cannot
be defined using the C API. Inherited member initializers from an Alore
superclass are executed normally, though.

@h2 Defining member variables

<p>The macros A_VAR and A_EMPTY_CONST can be used within classes to
define member variables and constants. Each member variable and constant is
associated with a single (member variable) slot.

@fun A_VAR(name)
@desc Define a member variable with the specified name. The member variable
      will be initialized to nil during object construction, before calling
      create.
@end

@fun A_EMPTY_CONST(name)
@desc Define a constant initialized to nil with the specified name. You should
      initialize the constant in the create method using
      @ref{ASetMemberDirect}. You must not change the value of a member
      constant after leaving the constructor.
@end

@h2 Defining accessors

<p>Accessors (getters and setters) can be defined for C classes using the
A_GETTER and A_SETTER macros. The ordinary rules for defining accessors apply,
including these:

<ul>
  <li>You cannot define an accessor for a member that has been defined as a
    member variable or constant in the same class.
  <li>You cannot define a setter unless there is also a getter defined for the
     same member.
</ul>

@fun A_GETTER(name, numTemps, cFunc)
@desc Define a getter method for the member with the specified name.
      The C function should be
      implemented like a method that receives no arguments except self.
@end

@fun A_SETTER(name, numTemps, cFunc)
@desc Define a setter method for the member with the specified name.
      The C function should be
      implemented like a method that receives a single argument (the assigned
      value) in addition to the self argument. A setter must always return
      ANil.
@end

@h2 Inheritance

<p>C classes inherit from @ref{std::Object} by default, but they can
optionally inherit from another class. The superclass can
be any non-primitive type, implemented in C or Alore. Subclasses implemented in
C can override methods and accessors. They can also access the original
definitions in the superclass by using C API functions @ref{ASuperMember} and
@ref{ASetSuperMember}.

@fun A_INHERIT(superName)
@desc Make the current class inherit from another class. The name should the
      fully qualified name of the superclass as a string. Use the
      form ::A if the
      superclass is defined in the current module. If the superclass
      is defined in another module than the current module or @ref{std}, that
      module must also be imported in the current module using @ref{A_IMPORT}.
      You cannot define more than a single superclass for a class using
      A_INHERIT.

      @note The A_INHERIT macro, if present, must always be the first A_ macro
            after the A_CLASS* macro that begins the class definition.
      @end
@end

@h2 Interface implementation

<p>C classes may implement interfaces using the A_IMPLEMENT macro. Any members
defined in the interface must be implemented in the class or a superclass.

@fun A_IMPLEMENT(interfaceName)
@desc Make the current class implement an interface. The name should be the
      fully qualified name of the interface as a string. Use the form ::A if
      the interface is defined in the current module. If the interface
      is defined in another module than the current module or @ref{std}, that
      module must also be imported in the current module using @ref{A_IMPORT}.
      You can use multiple A_IMPLEMENT macros in a class to implement more
      than one interface.

      @note The A_IMPLEMENT macros must always come immediately
            after the A_INHERIT macro (if present) or the A_CLASS* macro
            (otherwise).
      @end
@end

@h2 Accessing member variable slots directly

<p>The most efficient way of accessing member variables or constants is by
accessing the member variable slots directly using a <i>slot index</i>.
The first member variable or constant receives the slot index 0, the next 1,
etc. Member variables defined in the superclasses always receive the smallest
slot indices. Direct access can typically used to access only private members
variables, since any member which might have an overridden accessor has to
be accessed using other means.

<p>Member slots can also be allocated implicitly for internal purposes. The
macro @ref{A_EXTERNAL_DATA} allocates an additional slot just like an
@ref{A_VAR} macro. If the @ref{#f} method is defined in a class, a new slot
is allocated, and the slot 0 is reserved for internal use.
These slots are used internally by the Alore implementation
and your code must never access them.
