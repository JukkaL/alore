@title Intersection types

@note This section is a stub.
@end

<p>Intersection types allow you to define multiple signatures for a single
function, similar to function or method overloading in languages such as
Java, C# and C++.
Unlike the previous languages, Alore functions always have a single body.

@h2 Intersection type basics

<p>Specify an intersection type using the <tt>or</tt> keyword after a normal
function signature, followed by another signature without the function name.
This examples defines a function that can be called with either a
<tt>Str</tt> or <tt>Int</tt> argument:

@example
  def IncStr(x as Str) as Str or
            (x as Int) as Str
    if x is Str
      return Str(Int(x) + 1)
    else
      return Str((x as Int) + 1)
    end
  end

  IncStr('6')  -- '7'
  IncStr(5)    -- '6'
@end

<p>There a several things to note:

<ul>
  <li>The body of the function must type check for all signatures (both when
    <tt>x</tt> is <tt>Str</tt> and when <tt>x</tt> is <tt>Int</tt>).
    This is why we need the <tt>x as Int</tt> cast in
    the else block.
  <li>We use a runtime type check (<tt>if x is Str</tt>)
    to determine the actual type of the argument.
    In some functions with intersection types this is not necessary, but often
    it is.
  <li>The behavior of the function remains the same after type erasure
    (see also @href{Running programs with mixed typing}).
  <li>If the different signatures in an intersection type have different
    return value types, you
    may have to cast the return values to <tt>dynamic</tt> to avoid type
    check errors.
</ul>

<p>Alore standard libraries use intersection types in several places, most
notably for arithmetic operators such as +. They allow the following code
to type check:

@example
  2 * 3       -- Int * Int
  2 * 1.1     -- Int * Float
  2 * 'x'     -- Int * Str
@end

@h2 Overlapping signatures

<p>Signatures in intersection types must not be overlapping, unless they have
identical return value types. Consider this example:

@example
  def f(x as Int) as Int
       (x as Object) as Str
    ...
  end
@end

<p>When called with an <tt>Int</tt> argument, either of the signatures
can match; they are overlapping. This would not be a problem if the
return value types would
be identical, but they are different (<tt>Int</tt> and <tt>Str</tt>).

@h2 Interface methods and intersection types

<p>If a class implements two interfaces with an identically-named method,
you may be able to define an intersection type for the method that is
compatible with both the interfaces.
