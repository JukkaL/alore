@title Str operations

<p>Several operations are provided for dealing with string objects. The 
operations include creating string objects, converting between different 
string encodings, reading the contents of strings and creating substrings.

@see You can use the @ref{AAdd} function to concatenate strings. String methods
     such as <tt>strip</tt> can be called using @ref{ACallMethod}.
@end

<h2>Creating</h2>

@fun AValue AMakeStr(AThread *t, const char *str)
@desc Create a <tt>std::Str</tt> object from a a zero-terminated 8-bit string. 
      The character values in the argument are mapped to range 1 to 255 in the
      result. @raise-direct
@end

@fun AValue AMakeStrW(AThread *t, const AWideChar *str)
@desc Create a <tt>std::Str</tt> object from a zero-terminated 16-bit string.
      @raise-direct
@end

@fun AValue AMakeStrUtf8(AThread *t, const char *str)
@desc Create a <tt>std::Str</tt> object from a UTF-8 encoded string. The result
      is a 16-bit string. @raise-direct
@end

@fun AValue AMakeCh(AThread *t, AWideChar ch)
@desc Create a 1-element <tt>std::Str</tt> object from a character code. Any
      character code in range 0 to 65535 is valid. @raise-direct
@end

@fun AValue AMakeEmptyStr(AThread *t, Assize_t len)
@desc Create a uninitialized <tt>std::Str</tt> object with the specified 
      length. You must initialize the entire contents of the string using 
      @ref{ASetStrItem} or @ref{AStrPtr} before exposing the object to Alore
      code. You must only use 8-bit character codes, i.e. character values 
      between 0 and 255, when initializing the string.
      @raise-direct
@end

@fun AValue AMakeEmptyStrW(AThread *t, Assize_t len)
@desc Create a uninitialized <tt>std::Str</tt> object with the specified 
      length. You must initialize the entire contents of the string using 
      @ref{ASetStrItem} or @ref{AStrPtrW} before exposing the object to Alore
      code.
      @raise-direct
@end

@fun void ASetStrItem(AValue string, int index, AWideChar ch)
@desc Initialize a character within a string at given index to value ch.
      Only strings created using <tt>AMakeEmptyStr</tt> or 
      <tt>AMakeEmptyStrW</tt> can be initialized using this function.
      The index (0-based) must be non-negative and less than the length of 
      the string. After a string has been initialized, its contents must not
      be changed. This function performs no error checking.
@end

@fun unsigned char *AStrPtr(AValue string)
@desc Return a pointer to the contents of a string object created using 
      @ref{AMakeEmptyStr}. This pointer can be used to initialize the contents
      of the string. Any operation that may cause the garbage collector to run
      will invalidate the pointer. You must not store a zero terminator in the
      string or write past the end of the buffer. The size of the buffer is
      defined by the length of the string.
@end

@fun AWideChar *AStrPtrW(AValue string)
@desc Return a pointer to the contents of a string object created using 
      @ref{AMakeEmptyStrW}. This pointer can be used to initialize the contents
      of the string. Any operation that may cause the garbage collector to run
      will invalidate the pointer. You must not store a zero terminator in the
      string or write past the end of the buffer. The size of the buffer is
      defined by the length of the string.
@end

@fun AValue AToStr(AThread *t, AValue object)
@desc Return the string value of an object, equivalent to the valued produced
      by the call std::Str(object).
@end

<h2>Reading</h2>

@fun Assize_t AStrLen(AValue string)
@desc Return the length of a string. 
      The argument must be a <tt>std::Str</tt> object, since this function 
      performs no error checking.
@end

@fun AWideChar AStrItem(AValue string, Assize_t index)
@desc Return the value of a character in a string. The argument must be a
      <tt>std::Str</tt> object, and the index (0-based) must be non-negative
      and less than the length of the string. This function performs no
      error checking.
@end

@fun Assize_t AGetStr(AThread *t, AValue v, char *buf, Assize_t bufLen)
@desc Store the contents of a <tt>Str</tt> object in a 8-bit buffer as a
      zero-terminated string. The bufLen argument specifies the size of the
      buffer. Return the length of the string, without the zero terminator.
      Raise an exception if the value does not refer to a <tt>Str</tt>,
      if the buffer is too small to contain the string contents and the
      zero terminator, or if the string contains character values larger than
      255. @raise-direct
@end

@fun Assize_t AGetStrW(AThread *t, AValue v, AWideChar *buf, Assize_t bufLen)
@desc Store the contents of a <tt>Str</tt> object in a 16-bit buffer as a
      zero-terminated string. The bufLen argument specifies the size of the
      buffer. Return the length of the string, without the zero terminator.
      Raise an exception if the value does not refer to a <tt>Str</tt>
      or if the buffer is too small to contain the string contents and the
      zero terminator. @raise-direct
@end

@fun Assize_t AGetStrUtf8(AThread *t, AValue v, char *buf, Assize_t bufLen)
@desc Store the contents of a <tt>Str</tt> object in a 8-bit buffer as a
      zero-terminated UTF-8 encoded string. The bufLen argument specifies the 
      size of the buffer. Return the length of the encoded string, without the
      zero terminator. Raise an exception if the value does not refer to a 
      <tt>Str</tt> or if the buffer is too small to contain the encoded string 
      contents and the zero terminator. @raise-direct
@end

@fun Assize_t AStrLenUtf8(AValue string)
@desc Return the length of resulting string when a string is UTF-8 encoded,
      without actually performing the encoding, not including the zero 
      terminator.
      The argument must be a <tt>std::Str</tt> object, since this function 
      performs no error checking.
@end

@fun AValue ASubStr(AThread *t, AValue v, Assize_t i1, Assize_t i2)
@desc Return the substring i1:i2 of a string. The rules for indices are
      similar to when indexing substrings in Alore code, and
      negative indices are supported. As an exception, the constant
      <tt>A_SLICE_END</tt> as the end index
      specifies a substring extending to the end of the string. @raise-direct
@end

@fun AWideChar AGetCh(AThread *t, AValue v)
@desc If the argument is a <tt>Str</tt> object of length 1, return the 
      character value of the string. Otherwise, raise an exception. 
      @raise-direct
@end

<h2>Checking</h2>

@fun ABool AIsStr(AValue v)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether v is a <tt>std::Str</tt> object.
@end

@fun void AExpectStr(AThread *t, AValue v)
@desc Check if v is a <tt>Str</tt> object and raise a direct 
      @ref{std::TypeError} exception if it is not.
@end
