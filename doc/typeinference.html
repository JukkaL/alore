@title Basics of type inference

<p>The Alore type checker can often automatically <i>infer</i> the types of
local variables. Often the type of a variable is obvious, and an explicit type
annotation does not improve the readability or maintainability of your program.
In these cases giving the type is just extra work for the programmer. 

<p>Here are some examples of type inference:

@example
  def F(i as Int)
    var j = i              -- Infer j to be Int
    var s = 'abc'          -- Infer s to be Str
    var f = 1 + 1.1        -- Infer f to be Float
    var b = j > 1 or j < 4 -- Infer b to be Boolean
  end
@end

<p>Note that type inference only works for local variables (variables defined
within functions). Global variables and member variables need explicit types.
If they don't have a type, they are dynamically-typed by default (to be
precise, they have the type <tt>dynamic</tt>). Mixing dynamically-typed and
statically-typed variables is possible and often useful, and it will be
discussed later in section @href{The <tt>dynamic</tt> type and mixed typing}.

<p>Type inference uses the type of the initialization expression to infer the
type of the variable. The type checker always tries to pick the most specific
or descriptive type for a variable, but sometimes this is not possible. In the
simplest case, there is no initialization expression. In this case the
programmer must always provide a type:

@example
  def F(i as Int)
    var j as Int    -- Need explicit type (no initializer)
    i = j
  end
@end

<p>Similarly, if the initializer is <tt>nil</tt>, the type checker fails to
infer a meaningful type:

@example
  def F() as void
    var s = nil as Str
    s = 'abc'
  end
@end

<p>Sometimes (but rarely) the type checker can infer a type for a variable,
but this type is not the right one. In this case you can insert an explicit
type annotation. There is probably something tricky going on, so the annotation
serves as a useful reminder for programmer not familiar with the code (which
could be you in six months).

<p>Remember that the type checker does not infer types in the bodies of
dynamically-typed functions (dynamically-typed functions have no declared
argument or return values types). Type inference and static typing in general
require some additional work from the programmer, and one of the goals of
dynamic typing is to not require this work.

<p>The next section explains type inference with generic types. It requires
some new concepts to be introduced.
