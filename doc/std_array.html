<p>The <tt>Array</tt> class is a resizable sequence of items. The items can be
arbitrary values, and a single <tt>Array</tt> object can contain objects of
several different types.
The items are indexed using integers starting
from 0, which refers to the first item. Each item can also be accessed using a
negative index: -1 refers to the last item, -2 to the second to last item, etc.

<h2>Creating arrays</h2>

<p>Use an array expression <tt>[ ... ]</tt>
to construct arrays of a specific length:
@example
  []         -- Empty array
  [1]        -- Single-item array
  [1, 2, 3]  -- Array with 3 items
@end

<p>An array of an arbitrary length can be
constructed using the <tt>*</tt> operator. Example:
@example
  var n = 4
  [0] * n    -- [0, 0, 0, 0] (array with 4 zeroes)
@end

<p>You can also create an array from any iterable object using the
<tt>Array</tt> constructor:

@class Array([iterable as Itarable<T>])
@desc Construct an Array object. If <tt>iterable</tt> is given,
      iterate over it and append all the items to the created
      array. Otherwise, the created array is empty. Example:
      @example
        Array(0 to 3)      -- [0, 1, 2]
      @end
@end

<h2><tt>Array</tt> methods</h2>

@fun length() as Int
@desc Return the length of the array.
@end

@fun append(object as T)
@desc Add an item at the end of the array. The length of the array is increased
      by one.
@end

@fun extend(sequence as Sequence<T>)
@desc Add the items in the sequence to the end of the array. Example:
      @example
        var a = [1, 2]
        a.extend([3, 4])   -- a becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
      @end
@end

@fun insertAt(index as Int, object as T)
@desc Insert an item at the specified position. The length of the array is
    increased by one. The index argument is the index of the inserted object:
    for example, <tt>array.insertAt(0, x)</tt> inserts <tt>x</tt> as the first
    item of the array, shifting any other elements in the array to a higher
    index.
@end

@fun remove(object as T)
@desc Remove all instances of the object from array. The length of array is
      decreased by one for each removed instance.
@end

@fun removeAt(index as Int) as T
@desc Remove an item at the specified index, and return the item.
      The length of the array is decreased by one.
@end

@fun index(item as Object) as Int
@desc Return the smallest (non-negative) index of the array that contains the
      item, or raise @ref{ValueError} if the array does not contain the item.
@end

@fun count(item as Object)
@desc Return the number of times an item is present in the array.
@end

@fun iterator() as Iterator<T>
@desc Return an iterator object that can be used to sequentially iterate over
  the array items, starting from the first item.
@end

@fun copy() as Array<T>
@desc Return a new array object with the same length and the same items as
  the original array.
  @note Only item references are copied to the new array
    &#8212; the items itself are not duplicated.
  @end
@end

@fun find(item as Object) as Int
@desc @deprecated
      Return the smallest (non-negative) index of the array that contains the
      item, or -1 if the array does not contain the item.
      
@end

<h2><tt>Array</tt> operations</h2>

<p><tt>Array</tt> objects support the following operations:

@op array[n] @optype{Array<T>[Int] -> Int}
@desc Access and modify array items, including subsequences, with the indexing
      operator. The index <tt>n</tt> must be an integer or a pair. If the
      index is an integer, an @ref{IndexError} exception is raised if the index
      is not within bounds.
      
      <p>Indexing with a pair <tt>x</tt> <tt>:</tt> <tt>y</tt> constructs a new
      array object (slice) that contains the items
      <tt>a[x]</tt>, <tt>a[x + 1]</tt>, ..., <tt>a[y - 1]</tt>
      in the original array <tt>a</tt>
      (negative indices are first normalized to equivalent positive values).
      It cannot be used for
      modifying array items. Slicing succeeds even if the range
      bounds are not within the valid range of array indices. In this case,
      the bounds
      are clipped to lie within the valid range of values. If the left value
      of the pair is omitted (or is <tt>nil</tt>), it is assumed to be 0.
      If the right value is omitted or <tt>nil</tt>, the result is a slice
      extending to the end of the array.
      
      @example
        var a = ["a", "b", "c"]
        a[1]        -- "b"
        a[-1]       -- "c"
        a[1:3]      -- ["b", "c"]
        a[:2]       -- ["a", "b"]
        a[1:]       -- ["b", "c"]
      @end
@end

@op array * n @optype{Array<T> * Int -> Array<T>}
@op n * array @optype{Int * Array<T> -> Array<T>}
@desc Construct an <tt>Array</tt> object which contains the items
    in the <tt>array</tt> operand repeated <tt>n</tt> times. The operand
    <tt>n</tt> must must be a non-negative integer. Example:
    @example
      [0] * 5             -- [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      [1, "x"] * 2        -- [1, "x", 1, "x"]
      [x] * 0             -- []
    @end
    @note The items in the new array will point to the same objects as in the
          original array. Thus this operation alone is not useful for
          constructing multidimensional arrays.
    @end
@end

@op for x in array @optype{for T in Array<T>}
@desc Array items can be enumerated with a for loop, starting from the first
      item.
@end

@op array == x @optype{Array<T> == Object -> Boolean}
@op array < x, array > x
@desc Arrays can be compared for equality and for lexicographic order. All the
  basic comparison operators are supported: ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;
  and &gt;=.
  Arrays can be compared with tuples, and an array and a tuple
  with the same items are equivalent.
@end

@op x in array @optype{Object in Array<T>}
@desc Test whether an array contains a specific object. Return a boolean value.
      The test is not recursive, i.e., arrays within arrays are not searched.
@end

@op x, y, z = array
@desc Array objects can be expanded in a multi-assignment or a variable 
      definition. The number of items
      in the lvalue must equal the length of the array.
      @example
        var a = [1, 3, 5]
        var x, y, z = a    -- x gets 1, y gets 3, z gets 5
      @end
@end

@op array + x @optype{Array<T> + Array<T> -> Array<T>}
@desc Arrays can be concatenated together. A new array is created that contains
      the concatenation of the operand arrays.
@end

@op Str(array)
@desc Return a string representation of the array contents.
@end

@op Hash(array)
@desc Return the hash value of an array.
@end
