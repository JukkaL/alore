@title Defining interfaces

<p>C modules may also define interfaces.
An interface definition starts with the macro A_INTERFACE,
and ends with A_END_INTERFACE(). The contents of the interface, including
its members and superinterface (if any), are defined within these macros using
the same macros that are used for defining classes. These macros are described
in the previous section.

<p>In particular, the following macros (and their different variants) can be
used within interfaces:

<ul>
  <li>@ref{A_DEF} for defining interface methods
  <li>@ref{A_GETTER} for defining getters
  <li>@ref{A_SETTER} for defining setters
  <li>@ref{A_INHERIT} for interface inheritance
</ul>

@fun A_INTERFACE(name)
@desc Define a C interface with the given name. The definition of the interface
      follows this macro, and is terminated with the A_END_INTERFACE macro.
      Interface definitions cannot be nested.
@end

@fun A_END_INTERFACE()
@desc Mark the end of an interface definition.
@end
