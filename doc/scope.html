@title Scope of definitions

<p>This section discusses the scope (visibility) of variables. Variables,
functions and other definitions can only be accessed in expressions and other 
contexts when they are visible. If a definition is not visible at some 
location, its name has no special meaning at that location and acts as if the
definition did not exist at all.

<p>Sometimes another definition with the same name <i>shadows</i> a visible 
definition. There are different ways of accessing global and member 
definitions, and some of these can often be used to access shadowed 
definitions.

@h2 Global definitions

<p>All global definitions are visible in all the files of the module that
defines them. Public global definitions are also visible in the files that
import the module that defines them.

@h2 Class members

<p>Class members can be accessed in two ways: through the <tt>self</tt> object 
or through another object. Access through the <tt>self</tt> object is possible 
by accessing the name of a member directly in the body of a class without the 
member access operator <tt>"."</tt> or by using the member access operator with
the <tt>self</tt> keyword as the object.

<p>All members defined in a class, public and private, and all public members
defined in any superclass can be accessed through the
<tt>self</tt> keyword. 
If members are accessed through any other means,
only public members defined in the class or inherited from a superclass can be
accessed.

<p>If a name is overridden in a subclass, i.e. there is another public
definition with the same name as a public definition in a superclass, the
definition in the subclass will take precedence over the definition in the
superclass.

@h2 Local variables

<p>Local variables declared using the <tt>var</tt> keyword are visible only in 
the block that defines them, and only in the statements succeeding the
variable definition. Method and function formal arguments are visible in the
entire body of the method or the function. A local variable is also visible
within any anonymous function expression (both in the argument list and the
body of the anonymous function) that is within the visibility range of the
local variable.

<p>The item variable in
a for loop and the exception variable in a try-except statement are visible
only in the block that follows the variable declaration.

@h2 Precedence of names

<p>If an identifier may refer to multiple visible definitions, these 
ambiguities will be handled in the following manner:

<ol>
  <li>Local variable definitions take precedence over all other definitions.
  <li>Member definitions take precedence over global definitions.
  <li>Global names defined in the module that contains the reference take
    precedence over names defined in other modules.
  <li>Fully qualified names take precedence over not fully qualified names.
</ol>

<p>If the name cannot be disambiguated with these rules, a compile error
will be generated.

@h2 Name clashes

<p>It is an error to define multiple definitions with the same name in a single
scope. In particular:

<ul>
  <li>No module may define multiple global definitions with the same name.
  <li>No class may define multiple definitions (including method, getter,
    setter and member variable definitions) with a same name, except that:
    <ul>
    <li>It is valid to override definitions inherited from a superclass.
    <li>It is valid to define a setter and a getter with the same name, but
    <ul>
      <li>it is an error to define a setter for a member that has only a
        getter defined in a superclass, i.e. a subclass cannot change a
        read-only member to a read-write member.
    </ul>
    </ul>
  <li>There may not be multiple local variables with the same name visible
    at any location (formal arguments, for loop item variables and try-except
    exception variables are counted as local variables). As a result of this
    rule, an anonymous function may not introduce a local variable with the
    same name as a visible local variable defined in a surrounding function.
</ul>
