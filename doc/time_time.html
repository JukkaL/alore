<p>The <tt>Time</tt> class represents elapsed time or the time difference
between two points in time. <tt>Time</tt> instances
are immutable. <tt>Time</tt> values can be negative, zero or positive.

<p>There is no upper or lower bound for the values that <tt>Time</tt> can
represent. <tt>Time</tt> objects always have nanosecond precision, and this
is independent of the magnitude of the value.

@class Time()
@desc Construct a <tt>Time</tt> object representing the current clock time
      (time passed since midnight).
@end

@class Time(days as Int, hours as Int, minutes as Int, seconds as Int)
@class Time(days as Int, hours as Int, minutes as Int, seconds as Float)
@desc Construct a <tt>Time</tt> object representing a specific duration.
      Seconds must be
      a float or an integer and all other arguments must
      be integers. None of the values are restricted to any specific
      range. If they are outside the valid range of values, they are
      normalized and the excess is moved to the larger units. So if
      seconds is 64, the actual second value becomes 4 and minutes are
      incremented by one, etc.
@end

@class Time(seconds as Int)
@class Time(seconds as Float)
@desc  Construct a <tt>Time</tt> instance from a number of seconds. This is
       a shorthand for <tt>Time(0, 0, 0, seconds)</tt>.
@end

@class Time(string as Str[, format as Str])
@desc Construct a <tt>Time</tt> object from a string.
      The format argument specifies the
      format of the string. If the format is omitted, the accepted formats are
      "-h:mm:ss.s" and "-d\d h:mm:ss.s".

      <p>The format must contain <i>format sequences</i> for some
      time components (day, hour, minute, second). A format sequence matches a
      time component in the string. The following list contains all the
      available format sequences and examples of valid values:

      <table class="no-border" summary="Format sequences">
        <tr>
          <td>s
          <td>seconds (1, 30)
        <tr>
          <td>ss
          <td>seconds, at least 2 digits (01, 30)
        <tr>
          <td>s.s
          <td>seconds with an optional fraction (5, 5.0, 5.12, ...)
        <tr>
          <td>ss.s
          <td>seconds with an optional fraction, at least 2 digits in the
              integer part
              (05, 05.0, 05.12, ...)
        <tr>
          <td>m
          <td>minutes (1, 30)
        <tr>
          <td>mm
          <td>minutes, at least 2 digits (01, 30)
        <tr>

          <td>hours (1, 13)

        <tr>
          <td>d
          <td>days (1, 1234)
        <tr>
          <td>dd,&nbsp;ddd,&nbsp;...&nbsp;
          <td>days; at least <i>n</i> digits, where <i>n</i> is the number of
            d's (01, 023, ...)
        <tr>

          <td>sign of the value (empty or "-")
        <tr>
          <td>[am/pm]
          <td>specifier for a.m. or p.m. (all h and hh sequences
              in the same format string will also follow 12-hour clock
              conventions; "am"
              and "pm" in the formatting sequence may be replaced with
              arbitrary strings, and the matched string must contain one of
              these strings)
      </table>

      <p>Any other characters in the format must be matched by the same
      character in the string. As an exception, a backslash \ followed by a
      character <i>c</i> must be matched by <i>c</i>.
@end

<h2>Members</h2>

<p>The members <tt>day</tt>, <tt>hour</tt>, <tt>minute</tt> and <tt>second</tt>
of <tt>Time</tt> are all constants. Either all these members are
non-negative or all the members are non-positive, depending on the sign of
the <tt>Time</tt> value.

@var day as Int
@desc Number of days (integer)
@end

@var hour as Int
@desc Number of hours (integer in the range from -23 to 23, inclusive)
@end

@var minute as Int
@desc Number of minutes (integer in the range from -59 to 59, inclusive)
@end

@var second as Float
@desc Number of seconds (float, -60 &lt; seconds &lt; 60)
@end

@fun format(template as Str) as Str
@desc <p class="trim">Format the time as a string.
      The template string defines the format of
      the result. The following <i>formatting sequences</i> in the template
      are replaced with formatted <tt>Time</tt> components (examples within
      parentheses):

      </table>

@fun toSeconds() as Float
@desc Return the total number of seconds represented by a time object
      as a <tt>Float</tt>. The return value may be negative.
      @note The return value may be imprecise due to the properties of
            floating-point numbers. Use <tt>toNanoSeconds</tt> to get a precise
            (integer) representation of the total number of seconds.

@fun toNanoSeconds() as Int
@desc Return the total number of nanoseconds represented by a time object

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>This example uses both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats:

@example
  var t = Time("2:13 PM", "h:mm [AM/PM]")
  Str(t)                           -- "14:13:00.0" (24-hour clock)
  t.hour                           -- 14
  t.format("h:mm [a.m./p.m.]")     -- "2:13 p.m."
  f.format("hh:mm")                -- "14:13"
@end
