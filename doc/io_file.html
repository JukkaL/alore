@index File

@inherits Stream
@supertypes

<p>The <tt>File</tt> class represents an open file as a stream.

@class File(path as Str, ... as Constant)
@desc Open a file for reading and/or writing. This class is a subclass of
      @ref{Stream}.
      The optional arguments may include @ref{Input}, @ref{Output} or
      @ref{Append}, or a combination of these. If none of these options are
      specified, the file defaults to <tt>Input</tt>. <tt>Output</tt> and
      <tt>Append</tt> options cannot be mixed. When opening an
      existing file for writing using the <tt>Output</tt> option, the existing
      file contents will be lost and the file length will be truncated to zero.
      The optional arguments may also include one of the buffering
      options @ref{Buffered}, @ref{LineBuffered} or @ref{Unbuffered}; if
      omitted, the stream defaults to fully buffered
      access. If the optional arguments include @ref{Protected}, the file
      access permissions are set so that only the current user can access the
      file, and the file must not exist before the call. This is only
      applicable if the file is opened in <tt>Output</tt> mode.
      <p><tt>File</tt> objects should be
      closed after they are no longer needed by calling the <tt>close</tt>
      method. Otherwise any system resources allocated to them may not be
      freed until the program exits.
      @note <tt>File</tt> objects are narrow (8-bit) streams. They do
            not directly support reading and writing the full Unicode character
            set. The file contents are interpreted as raw bytes and they are
            directly mapped to character codes. The @ref{TextFile} class allows
            you to create and access files encoded in several common
            encodings such as UTF-8. The File class is useful for accessing
            file contents as raw binary data or for accessing files encoded in
            ASCII or ISO Latin 1.

<h2><tt>File</tt> methods</h2>

<p>The <tt>File</tt> class supports all the methods of the 
@ref{Stream} class (follow the previous link for more information) and these
additional methods:

@fun seek(offset as Int)
@desc Seek to a specific byte offset in the file. The next read or write
      operation will start at this location. The first byte in the file has the
      offset 0.
      <p>To seek to the end of the file, use <tt>seek</tt> with <tt>size</tt>:
      @example
        file.seek(file.size())
      @end
@end

@fun pos() as Int
@desc Return the current byte offset in the file. The offset 0 refers to the
      start of the file.
@end

@fun size() as Int
@desc Return the size of the file, in bytes.
@end

<!-- -->
@note The methods <tt>seek</tt>, <tt>pos</tt> and <tt>size</tt> are
      supported for regular files but might not work with special files such
      as devices.
@end

<p>The <tt>File</tt> class has these internal methods that are accessed
by the <tt>Stream</tt> superclass. Usually these methods are not accessed
directly:

@fun _write(...)
@desc Write the arguments directly to the file without buffering. The arguments
      must be strings.
@end

@fun _read(size as Int) as Str
@desc Read up to the specified number of bytes from the file directly without
      buffering.
@end

<!-- <h3>File constants</h3>

@ var name
@ desc The name or a description of the file. If the object was created using
      the constructor, the value is the same as the first parameter to
      <tt>File</tt>. Other streams such as @ref{StdIn} and @ref{StdOut} have
      descriptions of the form <tt>"&lt;...&gt;"</tt>.
@ end
