@title Class <tt>std::Range</tt>
@index Range

<p>Instances of the <tt>Range</tt> class represent ascending sequences of
integer values.
A range is defined by two objects, the start (lower bound) and the stop
(upper bound). The range includes integers from start up to, but not including,
the stop.

@class Range
@desc The <tt>Range</tt> type. Range objects can be constructed using the
    <tt>to</tt> operator.
@end

<h2>Member constants</h2>

@var start
@desc The lower bound of the range (included in the range).
@end

@var stop
@desc The upper bound of the range (not included in the range).
@end

<h2>Methods</h2>

@fun iterator()
@desc Return an iterator object that returns all integer values between the
  lower bound and the upper bound, in ascending order and not including the
  upper bound.
@end

<h2>Operations</h2>

@op x to y
@desc Construct a range object representing a range <tt>x</tt>, <tt>x</tt> + 1,
      ..., <tt>y</tt> - 1. Both <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> must be integers.
@end

@op for x in range
@desc A range can be enumerated in ascending order
  with a for loop, starting with the lower bound and ending with one less than
  the upper bound.
@end

@op range == x
@desc Range objects can be compared for equality. Two range objects are equal
  if and only if both their lower and upper bounds are equal.
@end

@op x in range
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether <tt>x</tt> &gt;= <tt>start</tt> and
  <tt>x</tt> &lt; <tt>stop</tt>.
@end

@op Str(range)
@desc Return a string representation a range.
@end

@op Hash(range)
@desc Return the hash value of a range.
@end
