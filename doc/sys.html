@title <tt>sys</tt>: Alore system information

<p>This module provides basic information related to the Alore virtual machine
and its environment.

<h2>Constants</h2>

@var Args as Array<Str>
@desc Command line arguments given to current program as a string array.
      These do not include the path to the current program. Consider this
      example:
      @example
        $ alore program.alo arg1 arg2
      @end
      Now the value of <tt>sys::Args</tt> in <tt>program.alo</tt> would be
      <tt>["arg1", "arg2"]</tt>.
@end

@var ProgramPath as Str
@desc Path to current program. It can be a relative or an absolute path, and it
      can refer to an Alore source file or a compiled binary executable file.
@end

@var InterpreterPath as Str
@desc Path to the Alore interpreter. It can be a relative or an absolute path.
      Multiple versions of the Alore interpreter may be installed at the same
      time, and the path always refers to the one that is running the current
      program. This constant is <tt>nil</tt> if <tt>IsStandalone</tt>
      is <tt>True</tt>.
@end

@var Platform as Str
@desc String identifying the current platform, in lower case. Currently
      supported values are
      <tt>"windows"</tt> (for all desktop and server variants of Microsoft
      Windows), <tt>"linux"</tt> (for all variants of Linux),
      <tt>"osx"</tt> (for Mac OS X),
      <tt>"solaris"</tt> (for all variants of Solaris) and
      <tt>"freebsd"</tt> (for FreeBSD). Additional values will be defined as
      the Alore runtime is ported to new operating systems.
      <!-- "mac os" for Mac OS X? -->
@end

@var IsStandalone as Boolean
@desc Boolean indicating whether the current program is a standalore executable
      (compiled binary file instead of an Alore source file).
@end
