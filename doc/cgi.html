@title <tt>cgi</tt>: Common Gateway Interface

<p>This module implements the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). CGI scripts are
called in response to HTTP requests by a web server. They can access the
request parameters and HTTP headers, perform any computation and generate a
reply in HTML or in any other data format supported by HTTP.

<p>The @ref{Request} class can be used for processing form parameters and other
information related to the HTTP request. This module also includes a number
of useful helper functions.

<p>A CGI script writes to the standard output stream the following data:

<ol>
  <li>some HTTP headers (at least Content-Type), each on a separate line
  <li>an empty line
  <li>the response data, in the content type specified by the headers.
</ol>

<p>Here is a minimal CGI script:

@example
  WriteLn("Content-Type: text/plain")
  WriteLn()
  WriteLn("response data...")
@end

<p>Refer to the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875">CGI
specification</a> (RFC 3875) for a detailed description of CGI.

@fun hasKey(name as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether there are any values for the named
      form control.
@end

@fun valueList(name as Str) as Array<Str>
@desc Return an array containing all the values for the named form control.
      The array may empty.
@end

@fun hasUpload(name as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether there is at least a single uploaded

      script, or <tt>nil</tt> if exactly the base URL was used.
      <p>For example, if the base URL for the script is
      http://host/script.cgi and the actual URL is
      http://host/script.cgi/path, <tt>pathInfo</tt> contains

      If the argument is <tt>nil</tt>, return <tt>nil</tt>.
@end

@fun SetMaxPostSize(n as Int)
@desc Set the maximum post size (in bytes). Raise @ref{RuntimeError} when
      constructing a <tt>Request</tt> object if the value of the
      Content-Length header is larger than this limit. Set the limit to -1
      to enable an unlimited post size.
      @note The default maximum post size is 10 megabytes.
      @end
@end

@fun ParseQuery(query as Str) as Array<Pair<Str, Str>>
@desc Parse an URL encoded query string into an array of key/value pairs.
