@title Class <tt>time::DateTime</tt>
@index DateTime

<p>The <tt>DateTime</tt> class represents a specific point in time.
<tt>DateTime</tt> instances are immutable.

@class DateTime()
@desc Construct a <tt>DateTime</tt> object representing the current time and
      date in local time.
@end

@class DateTime(year as Int, month as Int, day as Int, hour as Int, minute as Int, second as Int)
@class DateTime(year as Int, month as Int, day as Int, hour as Int, minute as Int, second as Float)
@desc Construct a <tt>DateTime</tt> object representing a specific point in
      time. Seconds
      must be a float or an integer and all other arguments must
      be integers. None of the values are restricted to any specific
      range. If they are outside the valid range of values, they are
      normalized and the excess is moved to the larger units. So if
      seconds is 64, the actual second value becomes 4 and minutes are
      incremented by one, etc.
@end

@class DateTime(string as Str[, format as Str])
@desc Construct a <tt>DateTime</tt> object from a string. The format argument
      specifies the format of the string. If the format is omitted, the format
      will be "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.s".

      <p>The format must contain <i>format sequences</i> for all
      <tt>DateTime</tt> components (seconds, minutes, hours, day, month, year).
      A format sequence matches a <tt>DateTime</tt>
      component in the string. The following list contains all the
      available format sequences and examples of valid values:

      <table class="no-border" summary="Format sequences">
        <tr>
          <td>s
          <td>seconds (1, 30)

          <td>ss
          <td>seconds, at least 2 digits (01, 30)
        <tr>
          <td>s.s
          <td>seconds with an optional fraction (5, 5.0, 5.12, ...)
        <tr>
          <td>ss.s
          <td>seconds with an optional fraction, at least 2 digits in the
              integer part
              (05, 05.0, 05.12, ...)
        <tr>

        <tr>
          <td>[am/pm]
          <td>specifier for a.m. or p.m. (all h and hh sequences
              in the same format string will also follow 12-hour clock
              conventions; "am"
              and "pm" in the formatting sequence may be replaced with
              arbitrary strings, and the matched string must contain one of
              these strings)
        <tr>
          <td>D
          <td>day of month (1, 2, ...,  31)
        <tr>
          <td>DD
          <td>day of month, at least 2 digits (01, 02, ... 31)
        <tr>
          <td>M
          <td>month (1, 2, ..., 12)
        <tr>
          <td>MM
          <td>month, at least 2 digits (01, 02, ... 12)
        <tr>
          <td>MMM
          <td>abbreviated name of month (Jan, Feb, ..., Dec)
        <tr>

        <tr>
          <td>YYYY
          <td>year, 4 digits (2005)
      </table>

      <p>Case is not significant in the month names and abbreviations.
      The YY values 69-99 are mapped to years 1969-1999, and 00-68 are mapped
      to years 2000-2068. It is recommended to use the YYYY format for
      years so that years before 1969 and after 2068 can be represented.

      <p>Any other characters in the format must be matched by the same
      character in the string. As an exception, a backslash \ followed by a
      character <i>c</i> must be matched by <i>c</i>.
