@title Low-level operations

<p>This section contains descriptions of several low-level facilities, most of
which deal with memory management. Note that using these operations is
generally more complex and error prone than using higher-level operations
described earlier, so be careful and read all instructions carefully.

@h2 Temporary locations

<p>The operations described below can be used to allocate additional locations
for holding temporary values so that they are seen by the garbage collector.
These are generally used in utility functions that can be called from various
Alore functions or methods implemented in C. Temporary locations that are used
directly in Alore functions or methods should be generally allocated in the
frame.

<p>Since these operations allocate the locations from a stack, the allocation
and freeing calls must be matched in a Last In, First Out fashion. However, if
a direct exception is raised before freeing, the runtime automatically frees
any unfreed temporary locations allocated after the point at which the
exception is caught. In general, there is no need to account for direct
exceptions when using temporary locations.

<p>The number of available temporary locations per thread might be fixed to a
relatively low value. Therefore avoid allocating a large number of temporary
locations and use Alore container objects such as Arrays for holding large
numbers of values.

@note These functions never cause the garbage collector to run if they return
      successfully. This means, most importantly, that they do not invalidate
      any AValues held in C local variables (unless an exception was raised).
@end

@fun AValue *AAllocTemp(AThread *t, AValue v)
@desc Allocate a temporary location in the temporary value stack of the current
      thread and store v in it. Return a pointer to the temporary location.
      You must call <tt>AFreeTemp</tt> before returning from the current
      executing Alore function or method to release the temporary location.
      The temporary location behaves like a location in the frame of a
      function. @raise-direct
@end

@fun void AFreeTemp(AThread *t)
@desc Release a temporary location allocated using <tt>AAllocTemp</tt>. This
      function does not check for error conditions and never raises an
      exception or causes the garbage collector to run.
@end

@fun AValue *AAllocTemps(AThread *t, int n)
@desc Allocate n consecutive temporary locations in the temporary value stack
      of the current thread and initialize them to some undefined value, for
      example AZero. You must call <tt>AFreeTemps</tt> to free these values
      before returning from the current executing Alore function or method.
      @raise-direct
@end

@fun void AFreeTemps(AThread *t, int n)
@desc Release n temporary locations allocated using AAllocTemps. This
      function does not check for error conditions and never raises an
      exception or causes the garbage collector to run.
@end

@h2 Instance binary data manipulation

<p>The following three operations (<tt>ADataPtr</tt>, <tt>ASetData_M</tt> and
<tt>AGetData_M</tt>) can only be used with objects of types that
have allocated binary data using @ref{A_BINARY_DATA} or @ref{A_BINARY_DATA_P}
macros. These functions perform no error checking.

@fun void *ADataPtr(AValue v, unsigned offset)
@desc Return a pointer to instance-specific binary data at the specified
      offset. The returned pointer will be invalidated by any operation that
      may trigger garbage collection.
@end

@fun ASetData_M(AValue v, unsigned offset, &lt;type&gt;, &lt;newValue&gt;)
@desc Modify the instance-specific binary data at the specified offset, storing
      a value newValue of the specified type. Example:
      @example
        MyData *ptr = ...;
        ASetData_M(frame[0], 0, MyData *, ptr);
          /* Self must have at least sizeof(MyData *) bytes allocated as
             instance-specific data. */
      @end
      <p>The offset must have proper alignment for the data type. See
      @href{Alignment of binary data} for more information.
@end

@fun &#60;type&#62; AGetData_M(AValue v, unsigned offset, &lt;type&gt;)
@desc Read instance-specific binary data at the specified offset,
      returning a C value of the specified type. Example:
      @example
        MyData *ptr = AGetData_M(frame[0], 0, MyData *);
      @end
      <p>The offset must have proper alignment for the data type. See
      @href{Alignment of binary data} for more information.
@end

@fun ABool ASetExternalDataSize(AThread *t, AValue v, Asize_t size)
@desc Use this function to inform the garbage collector of any external data
      included in object v that is not allocated from the garbage collected
      heap, since this data is not otherwise visible to the garbage collector.
      The garbage collector may take advantage of this information when
      scheduling garbage collection cycles.
      <p>If the exact size of referenced
      data cannot be calculated, it is sufficient to provide an estimation
      of the size. If the actual size is larger than the estimate, the program
      may consume more memory than it otherwise would. Conversely, if the
      actual size is smaller than the estimate, the program may spend more time
      in the garbage collector than it otherwise would.
      <p>Return TRUE if successful, FALSE if failed.

      @note Size must fit in a short Int. This operation may raise a non-direct
            exception.
      @end
      @note The type of v must have the @ref{A_EXTERNAL_DATA} declaration.
      @end
@end

@h2 Object construction

@fun AValue AMakeUnitializedObject(AThread *t, AValue type)
@desc Construct an instance of a type, but do not call the create method
      or setup the member variables. All member variables will be initialized
      to nil.
      @note You must initialize the object yourself after calling this function
            and before making the object visible to external code. You must
            not use this function to create objects whose internal structure
            might change. This includes all objects of all types defined in
            the Alore standard library.
      @end
@end

@h2 Memory management

<p>These functions can often be used as replacements for C malloc, free and
realloc calls. They allocate memory from the garbage collected heap, so unlike
memory allocated using malloc, these memory blocks are automatically freed by
the Alore garbage collector. The blocks allocated using these functions must
not be made visible to Alore code. All of these functions raise direct
exceptions on all error conditions.

@fun AValue AAllocMem(AThread *t, Asize_t size)
@desc Allocate a block of size bytes from the garbage collected heap. Use
      @ref{AMemPtr} to access the contents of the block, but note that
      this block may be moved by the garbage collector, and thus the return
      value of <tt>AMemPtr</tt> may change. As always, the ordinary rules for
      using <tt>AValue</tt> values apply to the return value.
@end

@fun AValue AAllocMemFixed(AThread *t, Asize_t size)
@desc Allocate a fixed, non-movable block of size bytes from the garbage
      collected heap. Use
      @ref{AMemPtr} to access the contents of the block. This block may not be
      moved by the garbage collector, and thus the return value of AMemPtr
      is guaranteed to not to be changed by the garbage collector. But note
      that the returned AValue must still be always accessible to the garbage
      collector while it is alive.
@end

@fun void *AMemPtr(AValue mem)
@desc Return a pointer to the start of the memory area related to a block
      allocated using @ref{AAllocMem} or @ref{AAllocMemFixed}. This block can
      be used to store any binary data, as long the boundaries of the block,
      specified by the size of block, are honored. Note that the block
      cannot be used to store garbage collected references (<tt>AValue</tt>
      values), and unless the block was allocated using
      <tt>AAllocMemFixed</tt>,
      it may be moved by the garbage collector at any memory allocation
      operation and thus the value returned by this function becomes invalid.
      The returned pointer is aligned to a 32-bit or 64-bit boundary depending
      on the current pointer width (32 or 64 bits, respectively).
      @note The alignment might be inappropriate for storing some data
            types (doubles, for example). Manual alignment enforcement may
            sometimes be needed.
      @end
@end

@fun AValue AReallocMem(AThread *t, AValue mem, Asize_t newSize)
@desc Change the size of the block allocated using @ref{AAllocMem} or
      @ref{AAllocMemFixed} to a new size. The original contents of the block
      are kept unless the new size is smaller than the old one, in which case
      the initial contents, up to the new size, are maintained. Return a
      reference to the resized block, which might be different from the original
      value. The return value behaves identically to a block just allocated
      using <tt>AAllocMem</tt> or <tt>AAllocMemFixed</tt>. The movability
      status of the block is remains the same as originally, i.e. if the block
      was allocated originally using <tt>AAllocMemFixed</tt>, the returned
      block will be non-movable. The mem argument must refer to a valid block.
@end

@fun void AFreeMem(AThread *t, AValue mem)
@desc Either do nothing or release the contents of the block referenced to by
      the mem argument. There must be no active references to the block when
      <tt>AFreeMem</tt> is called. Calling this function is always optional,
      since the garbage collector will eventually free any unreferenced blocks,
      and the implementation may also ignore this call.
@end

@fun AValue AAllocBuf(AThread *t, Asize_t initReserve)
@desc Allocate a growable buffer with initReserve bytes initially reserved for
      the buffer data. The buffer will be empty initially, independent of the
      value of the initReserve argument.
@end

@fun AValue AAllocBufFixed(AThread *t, Asize_t initReserve)
@desc Allocate a fixed, non-movable growable buffer with initReserve bytes
      reserved for the buffer data. The buffer will be empty initially,
      independent of the value of the initReserve argument.
@end

@fun void AAppendBuf(AThread *t, AValue buf, const char *data, Asize_t len)
@desc Append len bytes of data, pointed to by the argument data, to the end of
      a buffer allocated using @ref{AAllocBuf} or
      @ref{AAllocBufFixed}. The buffer is grown if not enough additional
      space has been reserved for the data.
@end

@fun void *ABufPtr(AValue buf)
@desc Return a pointer to the beginning of the memory area related to a buffer
      allocated using @ref{AAllocBuf} or @ref{AAllocBufFixed}. If the buffer is
      not fixed, any operation that may trigger garbage collection will
      invalidate the pointer. The available size of the area is specified by
      the accumulated number of bytes that has been appended to the buffer
      using either @ref{AAppendBuf} or @ref{AReserveBuf}. The alignment of
      the returned data is the same as for @ref{AMemPtr}.
@end

@fun void *AReserveBuf(AThread *t, AValue buf, Asize_t len)
@desc This behaves like like @ref{AAppendBuf}, but additional space
      is only allocated at the end of the buffer and not initialized. A pointer
      to the uninitialized data area is returned. This pointer behaves like
      the pointer returned by @ref{ABufPtr}, i.e. if the buffer is not
      fixed, any operation that may trigger garbage collection will invalidate
      the pointer.
@end

@fun void AFreeBuf(AThread *t, AValue buf)
@desc Either do nothing or release the contents of the buffer referenced to by
      the buf argument. There must be no active references to the buffer when
      <tt>AFreeBuf</tt> is called. Calling this function is always optional,
      since the garbage collector will eventually free any unreferenced
      buffers, and the implementation may also ignore this call.
@end

@h2 Value containers

<p>These functions can be used to create and access container objects. Each
container object encapsulates a single value.
The only special property of the container objects is the possibility of
creating a C-level pointer that can be used to read and modify the value stored
in the container. This pointer can live across function calls and returns and
memory allocation operations.
The effect is somewhat similar to that achieved using @ref{AAllocTemp}, but
the locations allocated with AAllocTemp can only live within a single function
invocation, and they must be freed in a strict LIFO order. Neither of these
is true for value containers.

<p>If you need to store multiple values, you can either allocate multiple
container objects or store a composite object such as an array in a single
container object.

@fun AValue AAllocContainer(AThread *t, AValue initValue)
@desc Allocate a container object that is initialized to the specified value.
      @note You must never expose the returned object to Alore code.
      @end
@end

@fun void *AContainerPtr(AValue container)
@desc Return an opaque pointer that can be used to access and modify the object
      reference stored in a container object, but only using the functions
      below. The pointer remains valid until the
      container object becomes unreferenced and thus may be garbage collected.
      This function performs no error checking.
      @note The returned pointer does not count as a reference to the
            container,
            since C level pointers are not visible to the garbage collector.
            You need to maintain a reference to the container object in
            a location that is accessible to the garbage collector, such as in
            another Alore object, in a function frame, etc.
      @end
@end

@fun AValue AContainerValue(void *ptr)
@desc Return the value stored in a container object. The pointer argument
      can be obtained using AContainerPtr. This function performs no
      error checking. In particular, the function does not check if the
      container object has been freed by the garbage collector.
@end

@fun void ASetContainerValue(AThread *t, void *ptr, AValue item)
@desc Modify the value contained by a container object.
      The pointer argument can be obtained using
      AContainerPtr. The argument pointer must be valid. @raise-direct
@end

@h2 Thread support

<p>Potentially long-running or blocking C operations must be surrounded with
<tt>AAllowBlocking</tt> and <tt>AEndBlocking</tt> calls, since otherwise the
thread performing those C operations may block other threads. In particular,
garbage collection cannot be performed during a call to an ordinary C function
unless the call is surrounded by these function calls.

@fun void AAllowBlocking()
@desc Allow potentially blocking C operations such as file I/O to be performed
      in the current thread. No Alore API functions (other than
      @ref{AEndBlocking}) can be called after calling <tt>AAllowBlocking</tt>
      until calling @ref{AEndBlocking}. This function enables other threads to
      run the garbage collector at any time without having to synchronize with
      the current thread. Normally the garbage collector can be run only at
      well-defined instants in each thread.
@end

@fun void AEndBlocking()
@desc Disallow blocking C operations in the current thread. This must be called
      only after calling AAllowBlocking to enable the normal mode of operation
      in the current thread.
@end

<p>Here is a short example of using these functions:

@example
  #include &lt;alore/alore.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  static AValue WriteFile(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      /* Note: Most error checking is left out for brevity. */

      char path[1024];
      FILE *f;

      AGetStr(t, frame[0], path, 1024);

      AAllowBlocking();
      f = fopen(path, "w");
      fprintf(f, "Hello\n");
      fclose(f);
      AEndBlocking();

      return ANil;
  }

  A_MODULE(example, "example")
      A_DEF("WriteFile", 1, 0, WriteFile)
  A_END_MODULE()
@end

@h2 Miscellaneous functions

@fun ABool ACheckInterrupt(AThread *t)
@desc Return TRUE and raise @ref{InterruptException} if the user has recently
      pressed Ctrl+C (or Ctrl+Break, depending on the operating system);
      return FALSE otherwise. You should call this function
      periodically in a long-running function or method invocation to enable
      the user to interrupt the program. You should generally propagate the
      exception to the caller when interrupted.
@end
