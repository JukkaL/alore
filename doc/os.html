@title <tt>os</tt>: Operating system services

<p>This module provides basic operating system services such as file and
directory manipulation. The path arguments expected by many operations must be
strings. The functions in this module raise @ref{std::IoError} on error
conditions.

@see File input/output is included in the @ref{io} module.
@end

<h2>File and directory operations</h2>

@fun Remove(path as Str)
@desc Remove a file or a directory. Only an empty directory can be removed.
@end
  
@fun Rename(sourcepath as Str, targetpath as Str)
@desc Rename a file or a directory. The operation may fail if the source and
    target directories differ.
@end

<!--IDEA: MakeDir(path[, option])-->
@fun MakeDir(path as Str)
@desc Create a directory. Raise @ref{IoError} if the directory already exists.
      <!--If the optional argument is present, its value must
      be @ref{io::Protected}. Normally, other users will be given read
      permissions to read the created directory. With the <tt>Protected</tt>
      option, only the current user may access the contents of the
      directory.-->
@end

@fun MakeDirs(path as Str)
@desc Create a directory and any missing parent directories. If
      the directory already exists or if the argument is an empty string,
      do nothing. Example:
      @example
        MakeDirs("dir1/dir2")  -- Create both dir1 and dir1/dir2 (if they don't exist)
      @end
@end

@fun ChangeDir(path as Str)
@desc Change the current working directory.
@end

@fun CurrentDir() as Str
@desc Return the current working directory.
@end

@fun Exists(path as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the path target exists. The path
      target may be a file, a directory, a symbolic link or a special directory
      entry such as a device.
@end

@fun IsDir(path as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the path refers to a directory or a
      symbolic link to a directory.
@end
  
@fun IsFile(path as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the path refers to an ordinary file
      or a symbolic link to an ordinary file.
@end
  
@fun IsLink(path as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the path refers to a symbolic link.
@end
 
@fun ListDir(path as Str[, mask as Str]) as Array<Str>
@desc Return the names of the directory entries in the directory as an array.
    The "." and ".." directory entries are omitted. The order of the entries is
    arbitrary.
    <p>If the mask is specified, only entries whose names match the file mask
      are included. The mask may contain the wild cards * and ?. * matches
      any substring and ? matches any character in the entry names.
@end

@fun WalkDir(path as Str[, mask as Str]) as Array<Str>
@desc Return the names of the directory entries in the directory and
    recursively in all subdirectories as an array. The "." and ".." directory
    entries are omitted. The entries are ordered so that contents of
    a directory are directly after the directory entry. Otherwise, the order
    of the entries is arbitrary. The entries in subdirectories include the
    relative path from the initial directory.
    <p>If the mask is specified, only entries whose names match the file mask
      are included. The mask may contain the wild cards * and ?. The mask 
      does not affect descending into subdirectories.

    <p>As an example, the call
    @example
      WalkDir("/home/mary", "*.doc")
    @end
    <p>may produce the result
    @example
      ["essay.doc", "work/study plan.doc"]
    @end    
@end

@fun MakeSymLink(sourcepath as Str, linkpath as Str)
@desc Create a symbolic link at the target path that points to the source.
@end

@fun ReadSymLink(path as Str) as Str
@desc Return the path to which a symbolic link points.
@end

<!-- -->
@note Symbolic links are not supported in Windows; the above two functions
      just raise @ref{RuntimeError}.
@end

<h2>Path operations</h2>
  
@fun Join(component as Str, ...) as Str
@desc Join one or more path components with the directory separator character
    ("/" or "\"). Examples:
    @example
    Join("work", "texts")  -- Result: "work/texts" (Posix) or
                           --         "work\texts" (Windows)
    Join("/usr/bin", "ls") -- Result: "/usr/bin/ls" (Posix)
    Join("a\", "b\c")      -- Result: "a\b\c" (Windows)
    @end    
@end

@fun DirName(path as Str) as Str
@desc Return the directory portion of a path, i.e. the last component in the
      path is removed. The return value does not have a trailing directory
      separator unless the value refers to the root directory. Example:
      @example
      DirName("/usr/bin") -- Result: "/usr"
      @end
@end
  
@fun BaseName(path as Str) as Str
@desc Return the last component in a path. Example:
      @example
      BaseName("/usr/bin") -- Result: "bin"
      @end
@end
  
@fun FileExt(path as Str) as Str
@desc Return the file extension of a path. The dot in the extension is
      included. If there is no extension, return an empty string. If there
      are multiple extensions, only the last one is returned. Examples:
      @example
      FileExt("/usr/bin")             -- Result: ""
      FileExt("/home/mary/essay.doc") -- Result: ".doc"
      FileExt("archive.tar.gz")       -- Result: ".gz"
      @end
@end

@fun FileBase(path as Str) as Str
@desc Return the path without the file extension. If there is no extension,
    return the path unmodified. If there are multiple extensions, only the last
    one is removed. Example:
    @example
    FileBase("work/essay.doc") -- Result: "work/essay"
    @end    
@end

@fun IsAbs(path as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the path is absolute (i.e. not
      relative to the current working directory).
@end

@fun NormPath(path as Str) as Str
@desc Normalize a path. Convert all directory separators to the canonical
      ones. Remove extra directory separators and unnecessary
      <tt>.</tt> and <tt>..</tt> path components. Example:

      @example
        NormPath("./foo//bar/../x") -- Result: "foo/x" (Posix)
      @end
      
      @note The returned path may refer to a different location if some 
            path components are symbolic links, as
            symbolic links receive no special processing.
      @end
@end

@fun AbsPath(path as Str) as Str
@desc Convert the path to a normalized absolute path.
      @note Symbolic links are not recognized, as with @ref{NormPath}.
      @end
@end

@fun ExpandUser(path as Str) as Str
@desc Replace a <tt>~</tt> or <tt>~user</tt> prefix in the path with the
      home directory of a user (the current user for <tt>~</tt>).
      Return the path unmodified if there is no prefix or if
      unsuccessful. On Posix systems consult the
      <tt>HOME</tt> environment variable and, failing that, the password
      database.
@end
      
<h2>Path constants</h2>

@var Separator as Str
@desc The path name component separator of the operating system (<tt>"/"</tt>
      for Posix and <tt>"\"</tt> for Windows).

      Posix and <tt>";"</tt> for Windows).
@end

<h2>Class <tt>Stat</tt></h2>

  using a string which may have any subset of the characters <tt>r</tt> 
  (read permission), <tt>w</tt> (write permission) and <tt>x</tt>
  (execute permission). If only owner permissions are specified, other users
  will receive the same permissions minus write permission. Group
  permissions default to other user permissions.
  @example
    SetPerm("essay.txt", "rw", "")  -- Owner will receive read and write
                                    -- access, others cannot access at all.
