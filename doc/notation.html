@title Notation

<p>This document uses a modified BNF notation to describe grammar and lexical
rules. Here are a few examples of grammar rules:

@example
  digit :: "0".."9"
  num :: digit+ | digit* "." digit+
@end

<p>This means that the <i>digit</i> rule is defined as a numeric character
and that the <i>num</i> rule is defined as either a string of at least one
digit, or any number of digits followed by a dot and one or more digits.

<p>Each rule starts with the name of the rule (<i>digit</i> and <i>num</i> in
the previous example), followed by two colons (<tt>::</tt>). The colons are
followed by a rule
definition. In the rule definition, the name of any rule refers to that
rule (the definition of the <i>num</i> rule in the above example refers to
the <i>digit</i> rule). Literal
characters and strings are entered within double quotes. The | symbol separates
alternatives. The + operator specifies that the previous
item can be repeated one
or more times, whereas the * operator means that the previous item can be
repeated any number of times or be omitted. Brackets [ and ] are used to denote
optional items, and parentheses are used for grouping.
Items can be put one after another to form sequences.

<p>Sequences are matched from left to right. Each repeated item is
matched greedily (as many times as possible) before the next item is matched.
For example, consider this rule:

@example
  x :: y+ [ y ]
@end

<p>The first item (<tt>y+</tt>) in the definition always matches as many y's as
possible, and the second item (<tt>[ y ]</tt>) can thus never match anything.

<p>Some special characters or sets of characters are entered inside angle
brackets, for example:

@example
  comment :: "--" &lt;any character except CR or LF&gt;*
@end

<p>This means that a comment contains two dashes followed by all the characters
before the end of the current line.

<p>Sequencing has the highest precedence, followed by repetition (+ and *).
Alternation has the lowest precedence. Parentheses can be used to override
operator precedence.
