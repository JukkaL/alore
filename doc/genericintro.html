@title Using generic types

<p>Simple types are good for many purposes, but they are poor at modelling
collection types such as arrays, maps and sets. Consider arrays as an example.
An array of integers seems to be a different type from an array of strings,
but they have many things in common.

<p><i>Generic types</i> allow types to have
<i>parameters</i> that modify the base type. For example, the class
<tt>Array&lt;T&gt;</tt>
has a single type parameter <tt>T</tt> which describes the type of the array
items.
<tt>Array&lt;Int&gt;</tt> is an array of integers, while
<tt>Array&lt;Str&gt;</tt> is an array of strings.

<p>This section discusses <i>using</i> generic types.
We discuss
<i>defining</i> generic types and generic functions later in Sections
@href{Defining generic types and functions} and
@href{Generic inheritance and generic interfaces}.


@h2 Using <tt>Array</tt> types

<p>The following two functions illustrate using different array types. They
simply return the first item of the argument array:

@example
  def FirstInt(ai as Array&lt;Int&gt;) as Int
    return ai[0]
  end

  def FirstStr(as as Array&lt;Str&gt;) as Str
    return as[0]
  end
@end

<p>The type of the first return value, <tt>ai[0]</tt> is <tt>Int</tt>, since
<tt>ai</tt> is an array of integers. Correspondingly the type of the second
return value, <tt>as[0]</tt>, is <tt>Str</tt>.

<p>Both of the array types in the previous example derive from the
same generic type <tt>Array&lt;T&gt;</tt>; here <tt>T</tt> is a type variable
that can be replaced with any type to create a type instance. All type
instances have the same members, but any type variables in the types of the
members are replaced with the type parameters of the type instance. For
example, the return value of the Array <tt>[]</tt> operator is declared to
be <tt>T</tt> (remember that the <tt>_get</tt> method implements the
<tt>[]</tt> operator behind the scenes; the return type of <tt>_get</tt> is
<tt>T</tt>).

@h2 Constructing <tt>Array</tt> instances

<p>The example above did not create any arrays. Creating an array object
with a specific item type is done using an expression of form
<tt>[...] as &lt;...&gt;</tt>. The item type is within angle brackets &lt; &gt;
while the array items are within the square brackets:

@example
  var a as Array&lt;Int&gt;
  a = [1, 3, 5] as &lt;Int&gt;    -- Create integer array with 3 items
  a[1]                      -- 3
@end

@h2 Type inference for arrays

<p>You can often leave out the <tt>as &lt;...&gt;</tt> portion when creating
arrays. In this case the array item type is inferred:

@example
  var a as Array&lt;Int&gt;
  a = [1, 3, 5]     -- Ok
  a = []            -- Ok
@end

<p>The most common case where you have to give the item type is when you
initialize a local variable with an empty array:

@example
  def F() as void
    var a = []      <span class="error">-- Cannot infer type of a</span>
    a.append(1)
  end
@end

<p>You can correct the code by giving array item type explicitly:

@example
  def F() as void
    var a = [] as &lt;Int&gt;       -- Ok, infer Array&lt;Int&gt; as the type of a
    a.append(1)
  end
@end

<p>You can also define the type of <tt>a</tt> explicitly. In this case it is
not necessary to give the array item type when creating the empty array:

@example
  def F() as void
    var a = [] as Array&lt;Int&gt;  -- Ok
    a.append(1)
  end
@end

<p>Note that in the first corrected example above the
<tt>as &lt;Int&gt;</tt> construct
applied to the preceding <tt>[]</tt> expression only; the local variable type
is inferred based on the type of the initializer. In the second example,
the <tt>as Array&ltInt&gt;</tt> construct refers to the variable declaration
as a whole. It is equivalent to the following:

@example
  def F() as void
    var a as Array&lt;Int&gt;
    a = []
    a.append(1)
  end
@end

@h2 Multiple assignment with arrays

<p>You can an array value as the rvalue in multiple assignment as in
dynamically-typed programs:

@example
  def F() as void
    var a = [1, 2]
    var b as Int
    var c as Int
    b, c = a        -- Ok
  end
@end

<p>Multiple initialization is also possible:

@example
  def F(a as Array&lt;Int&gt;)
    var b, c = a    -- Infer b and c to integers
  end
  F([1, 2]
@end

<p>We continue the discussion on multiple initialization later in Section
@href{Tuple types}.

@h2 Using <tt>Map</tt> objects

<p><tt>Map</tt> is a type with two generic type parameters, which is expressed
by the full type name <tt>Map&lt;KT, VT&gt;</tt>. Here <tt>KT</tt> refers
to <i>key type</i> and <tt>VT</tt> refers to <i>value type</i>. Using
<tt>Map</tt> objects is straightforward in statically-typed code:

@example
  def F(m as Map&lt;Str, Int&gt;)
    m['foo'] = 5
    m['bar'] = 3
    Print(m['foo'] + m['bar'])
  end
@end

<p>Constructing <tt>Map</tt> object is similar to arrays, but there are two
type arguments, and the arguments are given after the call to <tt>Map</tt>
using <tt>as &lt;...&gt;</tt>:

@example
  var m as Map&lt;Str, Int&gt;
  m = Map() as &lt;Str, Int&gt;
@end

<p>Type inference is supported for type arguments:

@example
  var m = Map&lt;Str, Int&gt;
  m = Map()      -- Ok

  def F() as void
    var m = Map(5 : 'foo', 3 : 'bar')  -- Infer type to be Map&lt;Int, Str&gt;
  end
@end

@h2 <tt>Pair</tt> objects

<p>The <tt>Pair</tt> type is also a generic type, <tt>Pair&lt;L, R&gt;</tt>.
Usually the type of a pair expression <tt>x : y</tt> can be inferred, for
example:

@example
  def F() as void
    var p = 1 : 'foo'         -- Pair&lt;Int, Str&gt;
    p.left                    -- Int
    p.right                   -- Str
  end
@end

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to specify type arguments explicitly. Do this
using the <tt>as &lt;...&gt;</tt> construct, as for other generic types.
In this case the <tt>Pair</tt> expression must be within parentheses
due to operator precedence:

@example
  (nil : 'x') as &lt;Str, Str&gt;     -- Pair&lt;Str, Str&gt;
@end

@h2 Generic type compatibility

<p>Two instances of a generic type are compatible, if their arguments are
identical. For example, the following code is valid, as it assigns a value
of type <tt>Array&lt;Int&gt;</tt> into a variable of type
<tt>Array&lt;Int&gt;</tt>:

@example
  var a = [1, 2, 3] as Array&lt;Int&gt;
  var b as Array&lt;Int&gt;
  b = a          -- Ok
@end

<p>As always, assignment only copies references to objects, not objects
itself. In the above example <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> will refer to the
same <tt>Array</tt> object.

<p>The type checker generates an error if the type arguments are different:

@example
  var a as Array&lt;Int&gt;
  var b as Array&lt;Object&gt;
  a = [1]
  b = a     <span class="error">-- Error: incompatible types
@end

<p>As an exception, if the type arguments include type <tt>dynamic</tt>
within them, the types may not
have to be identical. You can also sometimes work around the above
restrictions by using <i>dynamic casts</i>.
Section
@href{The <tt>dynamic</tt> type and mixed typing} discusses these topics.

<p>Types which have a subtyping relationship (also generic ones) are also
compatible.
See @href{Generic inheritance and generic interfaces} for a discussion on this.

@h2 Nested generics

<p>In the examples above, the type arguments of generic types were always
simple types. Type arguments with more complex types are possible and often
useful:

@example
  var a as Array&lt;Array&lt;Float&gt;&gt;   -- Array of arrays
  var m as Map&lt;Str, Array&lt;Int&gt;&gt;  -- Map from Str to Array of Int
@end

<p>You can use an array of arrays (such as <tt>a</tt> above) to represent a
multidimensional array:

@example
  a = [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
       [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
       [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]
@end

<p>Type inference supports complex types, as shown in the example above.
Actually, type inference is especially useful when dealing with complex
types, as otherwise programming can become very cumbersome. Compare
the above fragment to an equivalent one with explicit types:

@example
  a = [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0] as &lt;Float&gt;,
       [0.0, 1.0, 0.0] as &lt;Float&gt;,
       [0.0, 0.0, 1.0] as &lt;Float&gt;] as &lt;Array&lt;Float&gt;&gt;
@end

@h2 Constructing arbitrary generic instances

<p>You may have figured out the pattern for constructing generic instances
with explicit type arguments. You can construct an instance of arbitrary
generic type <tt>X&lt;T1, T2, ...&gt;</tt> like this:

@example
  X(...) as &lt;A1, A2, ...&gt;
@end

<p>The above form is called a <i>type application</i>. The first <tt>...</tt>
refers to the arguments to the <tt>create</tt> method; they are ordinary
values, not types. <tt>A1</tt>, <tt>A2</tT>, ... are types; they are the
values of the type arguments <tt>T1</tt>, <tt>T2</tt>, etc.

<p>For example, constructing an instance of @ref{Set}&lt;T&gt; with
explicit type arguments happens like this:

@example
  import set

  Set([1, 2, 6, 3]) as &lt;Int&gt;
@end

<p>As usual, the type application above is unnecessary as
the type checker can infer the type argument.
