@title Int operations

<p>The functions, types and constants described in this section are useful for 
dealing with <tt>Int</tt> objects. Two basic modes of operation are supported: 

<ol>
  <li>Converting between Alore <tt>Int</tt> objects and fixed-precision C 
    integer types, potentially causing overflow errors during conversions.
  <li>Using only Alore <tt>Int</tt> objects to support arbitrary-precision
    arithmetic.
</ol>

<p>The first mode is usually sufficient, and when dealing with existing C 
interfaces, it is usually the only realistic approach. It also makes dealing 
with integer objects in C code relatively simple. Thus this mode is
recommended 
unless arbitrary precision is specifically required. An overview of using this 
mode is given below:

<ol>
  <li>Convert input Alore objects to C integer types using functions such as
    @ref{AGetInt}. If the inputs are out of range, a @ref{ValueError} exception
    will be raised.
  <li>Perform any calculations using C integer types such as int or 
    @ref{AInt64}, without having to use the Alore C API.
  <li>Any integer result objects that are returned from functions or stored in 
    Alore objects can be created from C integer types using functions such as 
    @ref{AMakeInt}.
</ol>
    
<p>This approach usually results in efficient and easy-to-understand code, 
since the number of API function calls is minimized. A major downside of this
approach is the loss of Alore integer semantics, which are replaced with the 
often less desirable C semantics that include integer truncation and the 
limited range of integers.

@see Operations described in sections @href{Arithmetic operations} and
     @href{Comparison operations} such as @ref{AAdd}, @ref{AMul} and
     @ref{AIsEq} can be used with <tt>Int</tt> objects as well. They are 
     useful especially when dealing with arbitrary-precision integers.

<h2>Arbitrary-precision integers</h2>

<p>The previous operations mostly deal with fixed-size integers. Alore integers
have an unbounded size, and the functions described below are useful for
dealing efficiently with arbitrary-precision integers.

<p>Alore supports two different memory representations of <tt>Int</tt> objects.
A <i>long integer</i> representation must be used for integers that are larger 
than the constant <tt>A_SHORT_INT_MAX</tt> or smaller than
<tt>A_SHORT_INT_MIN</tt>. Other integers are always represented using the
fixed-size <i>short integer</i> representation.

<p>A long Int object is composed of "digits", fixed-size binary integers,
whose range is from 0 to 2**A_LONG_INT_DIGIT_BITS-1.
The digits are numbered starting from 0 (the least significant digit) to n-1
(the most significant digit), where n is the length of the long Int object. 
The most significant digit must always be non-zero.

<p>The magnitude of a long Int object can be calculated using this 
formula:

@example
  value = digit[0] * B**0 + digit[1] * B**1 + ... + digit[n - 1] * B**(n - 1)
@end

<p>Here B is the base or radix (2**A_LONG_INT_DIGIT_BITS). Note that we use
** to mean exponentiation. Negative long Int objects have a sign
flag set, so two's complement representation is not used internally to 
represent negative long integers, although Alore code generally sees integers 
following two's complement semantics.

<p>Example: If each digit is 16 bits wide, B is 2**16 or 65536, and the value
of each digit must be between 0 and 65535. Then consider a negative long Int 
object with the following digits, starting from digit 0: 5, 4 and 3. 
The integer value of this object is 
-5 - 4 * 65536 - 3 * 65536**2 == -12885164037.

<p>API functions that are useful for dealing with long Int objects are 
described below.

@note It is an error to create a long Int object if it is in the short Int 
      range, but the API does not enforce this constraint. Therefore you have
      to be very careful or try to use higher-level operations such as 
      @ref{AAdd} or @ref{AIsLt} that work with both short and long forms 
      transparently.
@end

<!-- FIX add some function for normalizing long integers so that it does not 
         matter if a long int is too small or the most significant digits are
         0 -->

@fun ABool AIsShortInt(AValue v)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether v is an Int object within the range
  of a short Int object (i.e. <tt>A_SHORT_INT_MIN</tt> to 
  <tt>A_SHORT_INT_MAX</tt>).
@end

@fun ABool AIsLongInt(AValue v)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether v is an Int object outside the range
  of a short Int object (i.e. <tt>A_SHORT_INT_MIN</tt> to 
  <tt>A_SHORT_INT_MAX</tt>). Note that if v is <tt>Int</tt>, either
  <tt>AIsShortInt</tt> or <tt>AIsLongInt</tt> is true, but never both.
@end

@fun AValue AMakeLongInt(AThread *t, int len, ABool isNeg)
@desc Create an uninitialized long Int object with len digits 
      (each A_LONG_INT_DIGIT_BITS bits wide), optionally negative. Use
      <tt>ASetLongIntDigit</tt> to initialize the contents of the object.
      After initialization, the most significant digit must not be zero, and
      the overall value of the object must be outside the short int range.
      You must fully initialize a long Int object before exposing it to Alore
      code.
@end

@fun void ASetLongIntDigit(AValue longInt, int num, ALongIntDigit digitValue)
@desc Initialize digit num in a long Int object to the specified value.
      The long Int object must have been created using <tt>AMakeLongInt</tt>.
      The least significant digit
      is numbered 0. Note that the value argument
      must refer to a long Int object and num must be in 
      the valid range, since no error checking is performed. After a long Int
      object has been initialized, its contents must not be modified.
@end

@fun ABool AIsNegLongInt(AValue longInt)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether a long Int object is negative. 
      Note that the argument
      must refer to a long Int object, since no error checking is performed.
@end

@fun int ALongIntLen(AValue longInt)
@desc Return the number of digits in a long Int object. Note that the argument
      must point to a long Int object, since no error checking is performed.
@end

@fun ALongIntDigit AGetLongIntDigit(AValue longInt, int num)
@desc Return the digit num of a long Int object. The least significant digit
      is numbered 0. Note that the value argument
      must refer to a long Int object and num must be in the valid range, since 
      no error checking is performed.
@end
