@title About primitive types

<p>Alore has a fixed set of primitive types: @ref{Int}, @ref{Str},
@ref{Float}, @ref{Boolean}, @ref{Constant}, @ref{Function}, @ref{Type},
@ref{Tuple}, @ref{Pair} and @ref{Range}. Primitive types share these common
properties:

<ol>
  <li>They are defined in the @ref{std} module.
  <li>Other types cannot inherit from primitive types.
  <li>Their instances are immutable.
  <li>Their instances support comparison for equality and hash value
    calculation with @ref{std::Hash}.
  <li>All primitive type constructors that accept arguments accept also
    objects of their own type to construct identical copies of them, so that 
    <tt>Int(5)</tt> and <tt>Str("foo")</tt> are valid, for example.
</ol>

<p>Additionally, most primitive types have special syntax associated with
creating instances of them.
