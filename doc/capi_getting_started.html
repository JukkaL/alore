@title Getting started

<p>Next we'll describe how to create a minimal C module and use it from an
Alore program. Then we'll proceed to introduce a few useful functions and
concepts. Finally, some miscellaneous important information regarding the API
is presented.

@h2 Hello module

<p>This C file defines a trivial module that contains a single function
Greeting. Greeting accepts no arguments and returns the string "hello, world"
when called.

@example
  #include &lt;alore/alore.h&gt;

  AValue Greeting(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      return AMakeStr(t, "hello, world");
  }

  A_MODULE(hello, "hello")
      A_DEF("Greeting", 0, 0, Greeting)
  A_END_MODULE()
@end

<p>Next we explain each line of code in the above example.

<p>The first line includes the Alore C API header file:

@example
  #include &lt;alore/alore.h&gt;
@end

<p>You must include this file in order to use the Alore C API. It
defines all the required functions, types and macros.

<p>All functions that can be called from Alore code have this signature:

@example
  AValue Greeting(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
@end

<p>They accept two arguments, of type AThread * and AValue *, and return a
value of type AValue. These
types and arguments will be discussed later in more detail. At this point,
is suffices to say that AValue represents a reference to a single Alore object.
The C-level name of the function (in this example, Greeting) is internal to the
module and not visible to Alore code, but for clarity it makes sense to keep
the internal and public names similar.

<p>The function constructs a single Str object with value "hello, world" and
returns it to the caller:

@example
      return AMakeStr(t, "hello, world");
@end

<p>Customarily the end of a C module file contains a module description that
is introduced with the A_MODULE macro. The arguments to this macro specify
the name of the
module, in this case hello. The name of the module must be included twice,
once without quotes and then quoted. We'll see later the reason for this.

@example
  A_MODULE(hello, "hello")
@end

<p>The module description describes the function, class and variable
definitions included in the module. The hello module only defines a single
function, named "Greeting" (hello::Greeting):

@example
      A_DEF("Greeting", 0, 0, Greeting)
@end

<p>The last argument to the macro is a pointer to the corresponding C function
that is called to execute the function. The two 0 parameters
will be described later
in detail, but the first one specifies the number of arguments the function
takes (in this case, no arguments).

<p>Finally, the module description must end with the A_END_MODULE() macro.
Note that the empty parentheses must be included.

@example
  A_END_MODULE()
@end

@h2 Compiling and using hello

<p>To use the hello module, you have to compile and link the source code.
The details of these tasks depend on your operating system and C compiler.

<p>In Linux, first compile the C file, here assumed to be
named hello_module.c, to an object file hello_module.o:

@example
  gcc -pthread -fPIC -c hello_module.c
@end

<p>Alore header files must have been installed to a directory that is in the
include path of the compiler, or the path must be passed to the C compiler
using the -I option.

<p>Then, the linker is used to build a shared library hello.so
from the object file:

@example
  gcc -pthread -shared -o hello.so hello_module.o
@end

<p>Multiple .o files can be used in this step. Any additional required
C libraries can be added using the -l and -L linker options.

<p>The last command generated the hello.so file which contains the
linked C module, ready to be used. Now save the following Alore program as
testhello.alo in the directory that also contains the hello.so file:

@example
  import hello

  def Main()
    WriteLn(Greeting())
  end
@end

<p>Finally, run the program normally:

@example
  $ <b>alore testhello.alo</b>
  hello, world
@end

<p>If you see that message, you have successfully compiled and run an Alore C
module! These Linux instructions also apply to FreeBSD.

<h3>Compiling in Windows</h3>

<p>In Windows, you first need to install the MinGW development tools and MSYS,
available at <a href="http://www.mingw.org">www.mingw.org</a>. Then
you can compile the module in the MinGW shell like this (replace instances of
<tt>C:/Alore</tt> below with the actual install path of Alore):

@example
  gcc -IC:/Alore/include -c hello_module.c
  gcc -shared -o hello.dll hello_module.o C:/Alore/lib/libalore.a
@end

<p>Note that unlike in Linux, the name of the compiled module file is
hello.dll.

<h3>Compiling in Mac OS X</h3>

<p>Use these commands to compile hello in Mac OS X using gcc:

<!-- FIX: Test these -->

@example
  gcc -c hello_module.c
  gcc -bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup -o hello.so hello_module.o
@end

<p>You need to have Apple developer tools installed. They are included in
the Xcode development environment installation.

<h3>Compiling in Solaris</h3>

<p>Use these commands to compile hello in Solaris using Sun's cc (select the
correct variant of the first command based on your processor architecture):

<!-- FIX: Test these -->

@example
  cc -KPIC -c hello_module.c              # Intel
  cc -xcode=pic32 -c hello_module.c       # Sparc
  cc -G -o hello.so hello_module.o
@end

<!-- FIX: gcc -->

@h2 Accessing function arguments

<p>As briefly mentioned above, you can define the number of arguments
a function accepts using a parameter for the A_DEF macro. Let's define a
function that increments an integer (this version is a bit limited, but soon
you will learn how to implement this properly):

@example
  #include &lt;alore/alore.h&gt;

  AValue Inc(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      int i = AGetInt(t, frame[0]);
      return AMakeInt(t, i + 1);
  }

  A_MODULE(hello, "hello")
      A_DEF("Inc", 1, 0, Inc)
  A_END_MODULE()
@end

<p>Three lines in this example require further discussion. First, the A_DEF
macro defines a function Inc that takes a single argument, as specified
by the second macro argument:

@example
  A_DEF("Inc", 1, 0, Inc)
@end

<p>This argument can be accessed in the function implementation as frame[0].
If the function would accept two arguments, the second argument would be
frame[1], etc. We use the API function @ref{AGetInt} to convert the argument to
a C int, or raise an exception if it is not possible (we'll describe exceptions
later):

@example
      int i = AGetInt(t, frame[0]);
@end

<p>Finally, we increment the integer by one, and convert it back to AValue
using @ref{AMakeInt}:

@example
      return AMakeInt(t, i + 1);
@end

<p>This example illustrates a typical approach to using the Alore C API:
First we convert Alore data to C types (in this case, using AGetInt), then
perform some processing with the data using C types, and finally we convert the
data back to Alore objects. Performing operations using C types such as int and
char is generally much faster than performing the same operations using Alore
objects or AValues. But there are also valid reasons for performing the
operations using only Alore objects without the conversion steps, and an
example is given in the next section.

@h2 Storing temporary values

<p>As functions get even slightly more complex than the previous example, it
is necessary to generate intermediate AValue values. An important property
of the AValue type is that you cannot generally store values of type AValue in
local or global C variables &#8212; AValues must usually be accessed
using pointers to specific locations, since otherwise the garbage collector
cannot manage them.

<p>Fortunately it is rather easy to allocate new AValue locations for holding
temporary values. The third argument of the A_DEF macro defines the number of
additional temporary AValue locations to allocate in the block
pointed to by the frame argument. These temporary locations are allocated
just after the function arguments.

<p>Let's return to the previous example, the incrementer. Since it converts
Alore integers to C int variables, it can only process integers large enough
to fit in a C int variable. Alore integers, however, have an unlimited
precision, and we would like our Inc function to support them correctly. This
can be accomplished by performing the addition using an Alore C API function
@ref{AAdd} which performs the Alore + operation:

@example
  AValue Inc(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      frame[1] = AMakeInt(t, 1);
      return AAdd(t, frame[0], frame[1]);
  }
@end

<p>We first construct an <tt>Int</tt> object 1. This is necessary, since
@ref{AAdd} takes two AValue arguments. This object is stored in the temporary
location frame[1], and finally the <tt>AAdd</tt> function is called to add
the first function argument and the just created object 1.

<p>We still have to allocate space for the temporary value frame[1]. Otherwise,
assigning to frame[1] might corrupt the Alore stack and cause crashes or other
problems. We change the third argument of A_DEF to 1 to reflect the fact
that we only need a single temporary location:

@example
  A_MODULE(hello, "hello")
      A_DEF("Inc", 1, 1, Inc)
  A_END_MODULE()
@end

<p>You might wonder if the temporary location is really necessary, since
it might seem better to implement the function using a single expression:

@example
      return AAdd(t, frame[0], AMakeInt(t, 1)); <span class="error">/* Error */</span>
@end

<p>This is, however, not permitted, but the reason is somewhat non-trivial, and
thus it is described only later in section
@href{Coexisting with the garbage collector}.

@h2 More C API functions

<p>This example demonstrates how to create an array object. It creates an array
object containing integers 1, 2, ..., n:

@example
  AValue Sequence(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      int i;
      int n = AGetInt(t, frame[0]);
      
      frame[1] = AMakeArray(t, n);
      for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          frame[2] = AMakeInt(t, i + 1);
          ASetArrayItem(t, frame[1], i, frame[2]);
      }

      return frame[1];
  }

  A_MODULE(example, "example")
      A_DEF("Sequence", 1, 2, Sequence)
  A_END_MODULE()
@end

<!-- IDEA: AGetStr example -->

@h2 Omitting the return value

<p>To signal that a function does not return a meaningful value, you can
return ANil, which corresponds to the Alore nil value:

@example
  AValue DoNothing(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      return ANil;
  }
@end

@h2 Important C types, constants and functions

<p>These important types are defined in the Alore C API:

@var AValue
@desc This type represents a single Alore object reference. In addition, a
      few special values (AError, ADefault) are supported.
      Note that these special values should not be used in all contexts. 
@end

@var AThread *
@desc This type represents the state of the current thread. This is an opaque
      type, and you should not access its internals directly. It can only be
      passed around and used as an argument to API functions. Each thread has
      a separate AThread * value.
@end

@var ABool
@desc This is a C-level boolean type, and it is equivalent to int. The
      constants TRUE (1) and FALSE (0) are also defined.
      @note Alore booleans are represented as AValues @ref{ATrue} and
            @ref{AFalse}. Be careful not to mix these types.
      @end
@end

@var AInt64
@desc 64-bit signed integer type.
@end

@var AIntU64
@desc 64-bit unsigned integer type.
@end

@var AWideChar
@desc 16-bit unsigned integer type that can be used to represent a 16-bit
      Unicode character.
@end

@var Asize_t
@desc Equivalent to the C size_t type.
@end

@var Assize_t
@desc The signed variant of Asize_t.
@end

<p>Here are descriptions of some AValue constants defined in the API:

@var AError
@desc This value is only used as a return value for functions that return
      AValue. It represent the case where an exception was raised in the
      function and it was propagated to the caller. Some exceptions
      can also be raised as <i>direct exceptions</i>, and in that case the
      AError return value is not used. This will be described later in section
      @href{Exceptions}.
      @see Use @ref{AIsError} (described below) to check if a value is equal
           to AError.
      @end
@end

@var ADefault
@desc This value is used to represent a missing value for an optional function
      argument. Any other value means that the caller provided a value.
      @see Use @ref{AIsDefault} (described below) to check if a value is equal
           to ADefault.
      @end
@end

@var ANil
@desc This value references the nil object. It also represents a missing return
      value (similar to return without a return value expression in Alore
      code).
      @see Use @ref{AIsNil} to check if a value is nil.
      @end
@end

@var ATrue
@desc This value references the True object.
      @see Use @ref{AIsTrue} to check if a value is True.
      @end
@end

@var AFalse
@desc This value references the False object.
      @see Use @ref{AIsFalse} to check if a value is False.
      @end
@end

@var AZero
@desc This value represents the number zero. It can be used instead of
      <tt>AMakeInt(t, 0)</tt>.
@end

<!-- FIX: A_VALUE_BITS?? -->

<p>These functions are often useful:

@fun ABool AIsError(AValue v)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether v is equal to @ref{AError}.
@end

@fun ABool AIsDefault(AValue v)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether v is equal to @ref{ADefault}.
@end

@fun ABool AIsNil(AValue v)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the argument refers to the
      <tt>nil</tt> object.
@end      

<!-- -->
@note You should not compare AValues using the C == operator. You should use
      functions such as @ref{AIsError} above or @ref{AIsEq} (described later)
      to compare Alore values.
@end

@h2 Important conventions

<p>All API calls may be implemented as macros, and therefore you should never
take pointers to them. Any macros may also evaluate their arguments more than
once. Therefore no side effects are allowed in arguments, and code like this is
invalid:

@example
  return AMakeInt(t, Counter++); <span class="error">/* Error */</span>
@end

<p>It should be replaced with something like this:

@example
  int x = Counter++;
  return AMakeInt(t, x);
@end

<p>The following naming conventions are used in the Alore C API:

<ul>
  <li>Types, functions and macros that behave more or less like functions are
    named using CamelCase, and they all start with 'A'.
  <li>Constants and macros that can be used outside functions are named like
    this: A_CONSTANT_NAME.
  <li>Constant values that can only be used within functions 
    are named like functions. Examples:  ANil, AError and ATrue. Even though
    these might be implemented as C global variables, you must not try to
    create pointers to them.
  <li>Macros that are used within functions but that do not behave like
    functions are named like functions, but have a _M suffix. Examples:
    @ref{AGetData_M} and @ref{ASetData_M}.
    <!-- FIX _P -->
</ul>
