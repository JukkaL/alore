@title <tt>unittest</tt>: Unit testing framework

<p>This module contains a simple unit testing framework that can be
used for implementing automated unit tests for Alore programs.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A test case tests a single feature of a program. A suite is a collection
of related test cases. Typically test cases are implemented as methods of a
test suite class. A test suite class must be a subclass of @ref{Suite}.

<p>The class below is a simple test suite that tests functions in the 
<tt>mymodule</tt> module, which we assume to define the function
<tt>Add</tt> and <tt>Multiply</tt>:

@example
import unittest
import mymodule

class MySuite is Suite
  def testAdd()
    AssertEqual(Add(1, 1), 2)
  end
  
  def testMultiply()
    AssertEqual(Multiply(2, 3), 6)
  end
end
@end

<p>Only methods whose names start with "test" become test cases of a suite.
The @ref{AssertEqual} function can be used to verify that two values are
equal.

<p>The @ref{RunTest} function is used to execute a test suite:

@example
  RunTest(MySuite())
@end

<p>The above program executes the two test cases <tt>testAdd</tt> and 
<tt>testMultiply</tt>. Any
test cases that raise an uncaught exception due to an assertion failure or
any other reason are reported to the programmer.

<p>If we save the program above as <tt>test.alo</tt>, we can run the
test cases like this:

@example
  $ alore test.alo
  2 test cases run, all passed.
  *** OK ***
  $
@end

<h2>Class <tt>Suite</tt></h2>

@class Suite()
@desc Construct a <tt>Suite</tt> object. All members defined in subclasses 
      that start 
      with <tt>test</tt> are assumed to represent test cases or child suites.
      Members that are instances of <tt>Suite</tt> represent
      child suites and other members are assumed to represent test cases.
@end

<h3><tt>Suite</tt> methods</h3>

@fun addTest(testcase as TestCase)
@desc Add a test case to the suite. This method can be used to add
      manually constructed instances of the @ref{TestCase} class or its
      subclass as members of a suite.
@end

@fun setUp()
@desc This method is called before executing each test case in the suite. 
      The default implementation does nothing. Override this to setup member
      variables, files and other common state needed by test cases.
@end

@fun tearDown()
@desc This method is usually called after executing each test case in the 
      suite, even if the test case failed.
      The default implementation does nothing. Override this to clean up the
      results of the <tt>setUp</tt> method or test cases.
@end

@fun skip()
@desc Skip the current test case. The number of skipped test cases is reported
      by @ref{RunTest}, and if the <tt>"-v"</tt> flag is present, they are
      also marked in the list of executed test cases as skipped.
@end

<h2>Class <tt>TestCase</tt></h2>

@class TestCase(name as Str[, suite as Suite[, function as def ()]])
@desc Construct a test case object. The optional suite argument defines the
      test suite that contains this test case. The optional function argument,
      a callable object that accepts no arguments, will be called
      when the case is run.
@end

<h3><tt>TestCase</tt> methods</h3>

@fun setUp()
@desc If suite is defined, calls the <tt>setUp</tt>
      method of the suite. <tt>setUp</tt> is called before running the test 
      case.
@end

@fun tearDown()
@desc If suite is defined, calls the <tt>tearDown</tt>
      method of the suite. <tt>tearDown</tt> is called after running the test 
      case even if the test case failed.
@end

@fun run()
@desc Run the test case. By default, calls the function given to the 
      constructor or does nothing if the function was not provided. This method
      should raise an exception on test case failure.
@end

@end-class

<h2>Functions</h2>

@fun RunTest(test as Suite[, args as Array<Str>])
@desc Run a test case or a test suite. The optional args parameter may be a
      sequence of strings that represent the command line arguments to the
      tester. Status information is displayed on the <tt>StdOut</tt>
      stream.
      <p>The args array optionally starts with a "-v" flag. If present, it
      causes the function to display the names of all test cases as they are
      being run. Finally, the args array may contain a test case filter
      pattern.
      The pattern may contain asterisks (*) as wild card characters. It is 
      used to specify the names of test cases to run.
      <p>Member <tt>test...</tt> of a test suite is named <tt>test..</tt>, 
      unless the test suite
      is a child suite, in which case the name is prefixed with the name of the
      parent test suite and a dot (.).
      <p>For example, if args is <tt>["testChild.*"]</tt>, only the test cases
      in the <tt>testChild</tt> child suite are run.
@end

@fun Fail()
@desc Fail a test case by raising @ref{AssertionFailure}.
@end

@fun Assert(bool as Boolean[, message as Str])
@desc Raise @ref{AssertionFailure} if bool is not <tt>True</tt>. If the 
      message is provided, it is associated with the exception.
@end

@fun AssertEqual(a, b)
@desc Raise @ref{AssertionFailure} if a != b.
@end

@fun AssertNotEqual(a, b)
@desc Raise @ref{AssertionFailure} if a == b.
@end

@fun AssertRaises(exception as Type[, message], function, arguments = [])
@desc Call the function with the given arguments. Raise @ref{AssertionFailure}
      if the function does not raise an exception of the type specified
      by <i>exception</i>. Additionally, if the <i>message</i> argument is
      given, verify that the <tt>message</tt> member of the exception is
      equal to the message argument. Example:
      @example
        AssertRaises(TypeError, Ord, [5]) -- Verify that Ord does not accept
                                          -- an integer argument.
      @end
@end

@fun AssertType(type as Type, x)
@desc Raise @ref{AssertionFailure} if x is not an instance of the specified
      type.
      @note Instances of subclasses of the type are not accepted.
      @end
@end

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

@class AssertionFailure([message as Str])
@desc This exception is raised when an assertion is failed in a test case.
      This class is derived from @ref{std::Exception}.
@end

@end-class
