@title <tt>string</tt>: String operations

<p>This module provides operations dealing with string objects. The functions
generally assume that strings are encoded in Unicode or a subset of Unicode
such as ASCII or ISO Latin 1.

@see The @ref{std::Str} type provides many useful string operations.
     The @ref{std} module also contains
     several basic operations and type constructors that can work with strings,
     such as @ref{Int}, @ref{Chr} and @ref{Ord}.
     The @ref{re} module supports pattern matching of strings using
     regular expressions.

<h2>Functions</h2>

@fun IntToStr(int as Int, base as Int[, numFill as Int]) as Int
@desc Convert an integer to a string representation in the specified base.
    If <i>numFill</i> is specified, pad the result with zeroes so that it
    contains at least <i>numFill</i> digits. Digit values greater than 9 are
    represented as letters from "a" to "z" such that "a" is 10, "b" is 11, etc.
    Valid values for base are from 2 to 36, inclusive. Examples:
    @example
    IntToStr(6, 2)       -- Result: "110" (binary)
    IntToStr(255, 16, 4) -- Result: "00ff" (hexadecimal)
    @end
    
    @see @ref{std::Int}
    @end
@end

@fun ExpandTabs(str as Str[, tabSize as Int]) as Str
@desc Return a copy of the string with all tab characters expanded into spaces.
      The default tab size is 8, and it can overridden by specifying the
      optional argument <i>tabSize</i>.
@end

@fun IsLetter(char as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the argument is a letter. The
      argument must be a string of length 1. The function recognizes also
      non-Latin characters, including (but not limited to) Cyrillic, Greek,
      Chinese and Japanese characters used for representing words.
@end
  
@fun IsDigit(char as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the argument is a digit. The argument
      must be a string of length 1. Only the characters 0, 1, ..., 9 are
      recognized.
@end
  
@fun IsWordChar(char as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the argument is a word character,
      i.e. a letter or a digit. The argument must be a string of length 1.
@end
  
@fun IsSpace(char as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the argument is a whitespace
      character such as a space, a tab or a line feed character. The argument
      must be a string of length 1.
