@title Class <tt>std::Type</tt>
@index Type

<p>Instances of the <tt>Type</tt> class represent types (classes or
interfaces). They are primarily used for constructing
objects (class instances) and for
testing the type of objects. The <tt>Type</tt> constructor cannot be used to
build new classes. New types can only be defined using the <tt>class</tt>
and <tt>interface</tt> constructs.

@class Type
@desc The <tt>Type</tt> type. You cannot call this object to create new type
      objects.

@see @href{Function types} in Introduction to Alore Type System.
@end

@see @ref{reflect::TypeOf} allows querying the class of arbitrary objects.
@end

<h2>Methods</h2>

@fun members() as Array<Str>
@desc Return an array of all defined public member names for the type. The
      order of the names is arbitrary. The array includes both members defined
      directly in the type and any inherited members.
      <b>Not implemented yet</b>
@end

@fun supertype() as Type
@desc Return the direct superclass (if the type is a class) or superinterface
      (if the type is an interface) of the type, or <tt>nil</tt> if none
      exists.
@end

@fun interfaces() as Array<Type>
@desc Return an array of type objects that contains all the interfaces that
      the type implements. It also includes any interfaces that any supertypes
      implement and any superinterfaces of implemented interfaces. It also
      includes any interfaces implemented using a <tt>bind</tt> declaration.
      Example:
      @example
        Int.interfaces()     -- Result: [Comparable]
      @end
@end

<h2>Operations</h2>

<p>Type objects support the following operations:

@op type(...)
@desc Construct an instance of the type by calling the type object. This
  operation is only valid for type objects that represent classes. The
  arguments are passed to the <tt>create</tt> method of the class.
  @note Some primitive types do not support directly calling the type object.
    Instances of these classes must be constructed using other means, such as
    by using the
    <tt>to</tt> operator for creating @ref{Range} objects.
  @end
@end

@op x is type @optype{Object is Type}
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether <tt>x</tt> is an instance of
  <tt>type</tt> or a subtype of <tt>type</tt>. If <tt>x</tt> is <tt>nil</tt>,
  return <tt>False</tt>.
@end

@op Str(type)
@desc Return a string containing the fully qualified name of the type.
@end
