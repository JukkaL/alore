@title <tt>loader</tt>: Dynamic loading of Alore code (deprecated)

@note This module is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
      The <tt>compiler</tt> module will replace it.
@end

<p>This module enables dynamic compilation of Alore source code files.
Dynamically loaded source files must follow the same conventions as ordinary
Alore programs. They may import any modules imported by the program that loads
the file and additional modules, potentially located in different directories.

@note It is not safe to load source code from untrusted sources. Malicious
      code may read or delete your personal data files.
@end

<h2>Functions</h2>

@fun Load(path as Str[, modulePath as Str]) as Module
@desc Load an Alore source file. Return a <tt>Module</tt> object that allows
      accessing public variables, functions and classes defined in the file.
      If compilation fails, a @ref{CompileError} exception will be raised.
      <p>By default, the constant @ref{ModuleSearchPath} specifies the
      module search path. The optional argument can be provided to override the
      default module search path. The format
      of the argument is the same as the format of the
      @ref{ModuleSearchPath} constant.
@end

<h2>Constants</h2>

@var ModuleSearchPath as Str
@desc The default module search path. It is a string that contains module
      search directories separated by @ref{os::PathSeparator}.
      The directories are searched from first to last to find imported modules.
      @note This constant is empty (<tt>""</tt>) if the program currently
            being executed is standalone, i.e. it was compiled using
            <tt>alorec</tt>.
      @end
@end

@class-hidden Module

<h2>Class <tt>Module</tt></h2>

<p>The <tt>Module</tt> class provides these members and operations:

@fun contents() as Array<Str>
@desc Return an array of the names of public global definitions in the source
      file. This includes variable, constant, function and class definitions.
      The order of the result is unspecified.
@end

@op module[name] @optype{Module[Str] -> dynamic}
@desc Return the value of public global definition. The <tt>name</tt> argument
      is the
      name of the definition as a string. Raise an <tt>KeyError</tt>
      exception if
      there is no public global definition with the specified name.
@end

@end-class

<h2>Exception <tt>CompileError</tt></h2>

@class CompileError(errorMessages as Array<Str>)
@desc Construct a <tt>CompileError</tt> instance. Messages should be an array
      of error message strings. <tt>CompileError</tt> inherits from
      @ref{std::Exception}.
@end

<h3><tt>CompileError</tt> members</h3>

@var errorMessages as Array<Str>
@desc Constant member that contains compilation error messages as an array of
      strings.
@end

@end-class

<h2>Shared modules and garbage collection</h2>

<p>Dynamically loaded code may not compile new copies of any already imported
modules. Therefore
any global variables in modules are shared between all source files in a
program, and module initialization is performed only once per module.

<p>As an exception to this rule, if only a dynamically loaded source file or
module refers to a module, and all references to code that may access this
module (including <tt>Module</tt> objects, function objects
and class instances)
are removed, the garbage collector of the Alore runtime <i>may</i> free and
destroy the module. In this case, a new copy of the module can be imported
later.
