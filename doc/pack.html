@title <tt>pack</tt>: Binary encoding and decoding

<p>This module provides low-level facilities for converting Alore objects to
and from packed binary representations (this is called <i>packing</i> and
<i>unpacking</i>, respectively). The packed representations are
<i>narrow strings</i> that can written to files, sockets and other narrow
streams. Strings containing character codes larger than 255 (wide strings) must
be encoded before passing them to the
packing methods (using the @ref{encodings} module, for example).

<p>This module is typically used for accessing and generating binary data
using standard binary formats, for implementing binary network
protocols and interoperating with lower-level languages such as C.

<h2>Pack formats</h2>

<p>Binary data can be packed in several different formats. Some formats can
only pack integer data, others floating point numbers, and finally there
is a format for string data. There are no separate formats for different
endiannesses &#8212; instead there are separate classes for packing and
unpacking big endian and little endian data.

<p>The table below contains descriptions of the supported formats, including
sizes of the packed representations and the corresponding Alore types that
can be packed into and unpacked from using each format (note that N in a format
name must be replaced by a valid integer):

<table id="pack-formats" class="with-border" summary="Pack formats">

      When packing, input strings may be smaller than the length; they will be
      padded with spaces so that the desired length is reached.

<h2>Packer classes</h2>

<p>There are two concrete packer classes, one for the big-endian (network)
byte order and other for the little-endian byte order. They both support the
same methods; the common abstract superclass <tt>PackerBase</tt> defines these.

<h3>Class <tt>Packer</tt></h3>

@inherits PackerBase
@supertypes

@class Packer()
@desc Construct a packer that packs and unpacks data in the big-endian
      (network) byte order.
@end

<h3>Class <tt>LittleEndianPacker</tt></h3>

@inherits PackerBase
@supertypes

@class LittleEndianPacker()
@desc Construct a packer that packs and unpacks data in the little-endian byte
      order.
@end

@class-hidden PackerBase

<h3>Class <tt>PackerBase</tt></h3>

<p>This is an abstract base class of the packer classes.

<h3>Methods</h3>

@note Instances of N in method names below must be replaced with an integer
      valid
      for the format. See the above table for details. For example, the actual
      methods for packing words are <tt>packWord16</tt>, <tt>packWord32</tt> and
      <tt>packWord64</tt>.
@end

@fun packByte(int as Int) as Str
@fun packWordN(int as Int) as Str
@fun packIntN(int as Int) as Str
@fun packFloatN(float as Float) as Str
@fun packStr(str as Str, len as Int) as Str
@desc Pack a value in a specific format. The argument must have a compatible
      Alore type for the format (integers are also valid when floats are
      expected). The result is a narrow string.
@end

@fun packBytes(array as Array<Int>) as Str
@fun packWordsN(array as Array<Int>) as Str
@fun packIntsN(array as Array<Int>) as Str
@fun packFloatsN(array as Array<Float>) as Str
@fun packStrs(array as Array<Str>, len as Int) as Str
@desc Pack an array of values in a specific format. The argument must be an
      array, and each array item must have a compatible Alore type for the
      format. The result is a narrow string that is the concatenation of the
      packed items.
@end

@fun unpackByte(str as Str) as Int
@fun unpackWordN(str as Str) as Int
@fun unpackIntN(str as Str) as Int
@fun unpackFloatN(str as Str) as Float
@fun unpackStr(str as Str) as Str
@desc Unpack a narrow string encoded in the format specified by the method
      name. The
      argument must have the correct length for the format. The Alore type of
      the result value is specified by the format.
@end

@fun unpackBytes(str as Str) as Array<Int>
@fun unpackWordsN(str as Str) as Array<Int>
@fun unpackIntsN(str as Str) as Array<Int>
@fun unpackFloatsN(str as Str) as Array<Float>
@fun unpackStrs(str as Str, len as Int) as Array<Str>
@desc Unpack a narrow string that contains any number of values encoded in the
      format specified by the method name. The argument must have a valid
      length for the format (any multiple of the single item length). The
      result is an array of values whose type is specified by the format.
@end

<h3>Examples</h3>

@example
var p = Packer()
p.packWord16(7)               -- Result: "\u0000\u0007"
p.packBytes([16, 128])        -- Result: "\u0010\u0080"
p.unpackBytes("\u0010\u0080") -- Result: [16, 128]

var pl = LittleEndianPacker()
pl.packWord16(7)              -- Result: "\u0007\u0000"
@end

<h2>Class <tt>PackStream</tt></h2>

@inherits Stream
@supertypes

@class PackStream(stream as Stream[, packer as PackerBase][, bufMode as Constant])
@desc Construct a <tt>PackStream</tt> instance that uses another stream for
      input/output. The <i>packer</i> argument,
      if present, must be a packer object. If omitted, the big endian packer
      will be used. The <i>bufMode</i> argument may be @ref{Buffered},
      @ref{LineBuffered} or @ref{Unbuffered}. If omitted, full buffering will
      be used.
@end

<h3><tt>PackStream</tt> methods</h3>

@note Instances of N in method names below must be replaced with an integer
      valid
      for the format. See the above table for details. For example, the actual
      methods for writing words are <tt>writeWord16</tt>, <tt>writeWord32</tt>
      and <tt>writeWord64</tt>.
@end

@fun writeByte(int as Int)
@fun writeWordN(int as Int)
@fun writeIntN(int as Int)
@fun writeFloatN(float as Float)
@fun writeStr(str as Str, int as Int)
@desc Pack data and write to the stream. The arguments are similar to the
      corresponding <tt>pack*</tt> methods (see above).
@end

@fun writeBytes(array as Array<Int>)
@fun writeWordsN(array as Array<Int>)
@fun writeIntsN(array as Array<Int>)
@fun writeFloatsN(array as Array<Float>)
@fun writeStrs(array as Array<Str>, int as Str)

      @ref{Array} return value and the type of its items.
@end

@fun eof() as Boolean
@fun seek(n as Int)

<tt>PackStream</tt> specific input/output methods.

<h2>Class <tt>PackFile</tt></h2>

@inherits PackStream
@supertypes

@class PackFile(path as Str[, packer as PackerBase], ... as Constant)

      arguments are the same as for @ref{io::File}. The <i>packer</i>
      argument, if present, must be a packer object (see above). If omitted,
      the big endian packer will be used.

      <p>Example:
      @example
        var f = PackFile("file.bin", Output)
        f.writeWord32(1234)
        f.writeBytes([1, 2, 3, 4])
        f.close()
      @end
@end

@end-class

<h2>Constants</h2>

@var HostByteOrderPacker as def () as PackerBase
@desc This constant refers to either @ref{Packer} or @ref{LittleEndianPacker}
      depending on the native byte order of the host system.
@end

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

@class PackError
@desc Raised when a packer class gets invalid input and cannot perform
      packing or unpacking. Inherits from @ref{std::ValueError}.
@end
