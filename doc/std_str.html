@title Class <tt>std::Str</tt>
@index Str

<p>Instances of the <tt>Str</tt> class are immutable strings. A string is a
potentially empty sequence of characters. A character is logically
represented by an integer code between 0 and 65535, inclusive. Alore has no
special data type for characters &#8212; characters are represented as strings 
of length 1.
Character codes can be queried using the @ref{Ord} function, and strings
with specific character codes can be created using the @ref{Chr} function.

<p>String objects may contain data in various encodings. String methods that
interpret string contents (e.g. <tt>upper</tt>)
assume that strings are encoded in the 16-bit Unicode encoding or any subset
of Unicode, such as ASCII or Latin 1. Some other modules can work with
arbitrary <i>narrow strings</i>, i.e. string objects with only 8-bit characters
(character codes between 0 and 255, inclusive).

<p>Characters in a string can be accessed using integer indices starting from 0
(the first character). Alternatively, negative indices can used to refer to
characters from the end of the string: -1 refers to the last character, -2 to
the second to last character, etc.

@see The @ref{string} and @ref{re} modules contain useful functions for
  dealing with strings. The @ref{encodings} module provides conversions between
  different character encodings.

@class Str(x)
@desc Construct an object of the <tt>Str</tt> type. Call the <tt>_str()</tt>
    method of the argument and return a value equal to the result, provided
    that it is a string. Objects of all primitive types (except <tt>Str</tt>)
    and the standard
    collection types provide a <tt>_str</tt> method.
    @see The function @ref{string::IntToStr} and the method @ref{Str.format}
         are alternative ways of converting objects to strings.
    @end
@end

<h2>Methods</h2>

@fun length() as Int
@desc Return the length of the string.
@end

@fun lower() as Str
@desc Return a copy of the string with upper case characters converted into
    lower case.
@end

@fun upper() as Str
@desc Return a copy of the string with lower case characters converted into
    upper case.
@end

@fun find(substring as Str[, start as Int])
@desc Return the index of the first occurrence of a substring in the
    string, or -1 if the substring cannot be found. The
    returned index is the index of the start of the match. If the argument
    <tt>start</tt> is present, only occurrences at index <tt>start</tt> or
    higher are considered.
@end

@fun index(substring as Str) as Int
@desc Return the index of the first occurrence of a substring in the
    string, or raise @ref{ValueError} if the substring cannot be found. The
    returned index is the index of the start of the match.
@end

@fun replace(old as Str, new as Str[, max as Int])
@desc Return a copy of the string with occurrences of <tt>old</tt> replaced
      with <tt>new</tt>, starting from the beginning of the string. If the
      <tt>max</tt> argument is present, only replace up to <tt>max</tt>
      instances of <tt>old</tt>. Examples:
      @example
      "x..x.".replace("x", "yy")    -- Result: "yy..yy."
      "x..x.".replace("x", "yy", 1) -- Result: "yy..x."
      @end
@end

@fun split([separator as Str[, max as Int]]) as Array<Str>
@desc Split the string into fields separated by the separator or by a run of
    whitespace characters, if the separator is not specified or it is
    <tt>nil</tt>. In the latter case, whitespace characters at the start and
    the end of string are not included in the fields.
    <p>Return an array 
    containing the fields. If the separator is given, the result contains
    always at least a single
    field, which may be empty. The optional <tt>max</tt> parameter specifies
    the maximum number of
    splits. The rest of the string will be returned as the last element in
    the array. Examples:
    @example
    " a    black cat  ".split()  -- Result: ["a", "black", "cat"]
    "a,black, cat".split(",")    -- Result: ["a", "black", " cat"]
    "a,b,c".split(",", 1)        -- Result: ["a", "b,c"]
    @end
@end

@fun join(sequence)
@desc Concatenate the strings in a sequence. Use the string as the separator.
      @example
        " ".join(["a", "black", "cat"])  -- Result: "a black cat"
        "".join(["a", "b", "cd"])        -- Result: "abcd"
        ", ".join(["cat"])               -- Result: "cat"
      @end
@end

@fun count(substring)
@desc Return the number of times a substring occurs in the string (without
      overlapping).
@end

@fun iterator()
@desc Return an iterator object that can be used to sequentially iterate over
  the characters in the string, starting from the first character.
@end

@fun strip()
@desc Return a copy of the string with leading and trailing whitespace
    characters removed. Only ASCII space, tab, CR and LF characters are 
    removed.
@end

@fun format(...)
@desc When this method is called on a format string object, return a string
    constructed according to the format string
    and the optional arguments. Most characters in the format string are
    returned unmodified:

    @example
      "foo bar".format()  -- Result: "foo bar"
    @end

    Empty brace expressions are replaced with method arguments converted to
    strings:

    @example
      "{} and {}".format(1, "2")  -- Result: "1 and 2"
    @end
    
    Brace characters can be added to the result by duplicating them in the
    format:
    
    @example
      "{{ and }}".format() -- Result: "{ and }"
    @end
    
    The contents of brace expressions may optionally be prefixed with a field 
    width specifier,
    an integer followed by a colon. The replacement is padded with spaces to
    have at least as many characters as the absolute value of the width. If 
    the width is positive, the result is aligned to right, otherwise to left:

    @example
      "{4:}/{-3:}".format("ab", "c")  -- Result: "  ab/c  "
    @end

    Brace expression for numeric arguments may contain an additional format
    template that specifies the format of the result. A fractional format
    template contains one or more zeroes, optionally followed by a dot, a
    (potentially empty) run of zeroes and a (potentially empty) run of hash (#)
    characters. The zeroes specify the minimum number of digits in the
    integer part and the fraction, and the hash characters specify optional
    fraction digits that are only included if they are non-zero:

    @example
      "{0000}".format(12)      -- Result: "0012"
      "{0.00}".format(12.345)  -- Result: "12.35"
      "{0.0####}".format(1.23) -- Result: "1.23"
      "{5:0.0}".format(1.2)    -- Result: "  1.2"
    @end

    A scientific format template contains a zero, optionally followed by a
    dot and a run of zeroes and a run of hash characters; and an exponent
    template. The exponent template contains 'e' or 'E', an optional '+' and
    a non-empty run of zeroes. The dot and the following zeroes and hash
    characters specify the number of decimals shown in the <i>coefficient</i>;
    the exponent template specifies the minimum number of digits and the type
    of the <i>exponent</i>:

    @example
      "{0.0e0}".format(1234)     -- Result: "1.2e3"
      "{0.0E0}".format(1234)     -- Result: "1.2E3"
      "{0.###e+00}".format(1000) -- Result: "1e+03"
      "{0.###e+00}".format(1200) -- Result: "1.2e+03"
      "{0.00##e0}".format(0.1)   -- Result: "1.00e-1"
      "{0e0}".format(15)         -- Result: "2e1"
    @end
@end
  
@fun startsWith(prefix)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the string starts with the prefix.
@end

@fun endsWith(suffix)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the string ends with the suffix.
@end

@fun decode(encoding[, strictness])
@desc Decode the string to 16-bit Unicode using the given character encoding.
      The strictness argument may be @ref{encodings::Strict}
      (the default) or @ref{encodings::Unstrict}. Use this to
      convert strings in 8-bit binary encodings to Unicode so that you can
      use them with operations such as @ref{lower}() that expect Unicode
      strings.
      
      <p>Example:
      @example
        "\u00c3\u00a4".decode(encodings::Utf8)  -- Decode "&#228;" in UTF-8 to 16-bit Unicode
      @end
      @see Module @ref{encodings}
      @end
@end

@fun encode(encoding[, strictness])
@desc Encode the string (interpreted as 16-bit Unicode) using the given
      character encoding. 
      The strictness argument may be @ref{encodings::Strict} (the
      default) or @ref{encodings::Unstrict}.
      Calling this method is
      equivalent to <tt>encoding([strictness]).encode(str)</tt>.
      
      <p>Example:
      @example
        "\u20ac".encode(encodings::Utf8)        -- Encode the Euro sign using UTF-8
      @end
      @see Module @ref{encodings}
      @end
@end

<h2>Operations</h2>

<p><tt>Str</tt> objects support the following operations:

@op str[n]
@desc If the index <tt>n</tt> is an integer, return the character at the 
  specified index as a string of length 1.
  If the index value is out of bounds, raise an @ref{IndexError} exception.
  <p>If the index is a pair <tt>x</tt> <tt>:</tt> <tt>y</tt>, return a
  slice containing the indices <tt>x</tt>, <tt>x + 1</tt>, ...,
  <tt>y - 1</tt>.
  If the left value of the pair is omitted or <tt>nil</tt>, it is assumed to
  be 0. If the right value is omitted or <tt>nil</tt>, the result is a
  substring extending to the end of the string.
  Invalid indices in range bounds are clipped to lie within the string.
  @example
    "hello"[2]       -- "e"
    "hello"[1:3]     -- "el"
    "hello"[3:]      -- "lo"
    "hello"[:-1]     -- "hell"
  @end
@end

@op substr in str
@desc Test whether a string contains a substring. Return a boolean
  value.
@end

@op for ch in str
@desc The characters in a string can be iterated with a for loop, starting
      from the first character.
@end

@op x + y
@desc Return the concatenation of two strings.
@end

@op str * n
@op n * str
@desc A string can be repeated any number of times by multiplying it with an
  integer. The integer must not be negative. Multiplying a string with zero
  results in an empty string.
  @example
  "foo" * 3    -- "foofoofoo"
  "x" * 0      -- ""
  @end
@end

@op x == y, x &lt; y, x &gt; y
@desc Strings can be compared for equality and lexicographic order. Order
  comparisons are based on the numeric values of characters.
@end

@op Repr(str)
@desc Return a string representing the string using Alore string literal
  syntax, and only using printable ASCII characters. Characters other than
  printable ASCII character are represented using the <tt>\uNNNN</tt> escape
  sequences.
  @example
  WriteLn(Repr("""foo" + Tab + "\uffff"))   -- Print """foo\u0009\uffff"
  @end
@end

@op Int(str)
@desc Convert a string to an integer.
@end

@op Float(str)
@desc Convert a string to a float.
@end

@op Hash(str)
@desc Return the hash value of a string.
@end
