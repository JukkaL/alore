@title Using C++ in modules

<p>It is possible to implement modules in C++. The main difference between
using C++ and C is that you have to define all your implementation functions
as <tt>extern "C"</tt> and, of course, use a C++ compiler such as g++ to
compile and link the module.

<p>All the instructions in section
@href{Using standard C libraries in modules} apply as well.

<p>Here is a simple C++ example module:

@example
  #include &lt;alore/alore.h&gt;

  extern "C" AValue Greeting(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      return AMakeStr(t, "hello, world");
  }

  A_MODULE(hellocpp, "hellocpp")
      A_DEF("Greeting", 0, 0, Greeting)
  A_END_MODULE()
@end

@note Implementing C++ modules has not received much testing and this
      section does not mention many potential issues.
