@title Using standard C libraries in modules

<p>Standard C libraries, i.e. functions declared in standard headers such as
stdio.h and stdlib.h, can be used in Alore C libraries. There are, however,
some additional issues that need to addressed and that require some additional
effort from the programmer in order to avoid problems in Alore C modules.

<p>Most of these issues have already been discussed in this document. This
section contains an overview of these issues and links to additional
information if it can be found somewhere else in this document.

@h2 Freeing resources allocated by standard C library functions

<p>The Alore garbage collector cannot see or automatically free memory
and resources allocated using
basic C functions such as malloc or fopen. The following
issues are related to this:

<ul>
  <li>Objects that contain references to resources allocated using malloc or
    another function should define a finalization method @ref{#f} and
    set the external data size using @ref{ASetExternalDataSize}.
  <li>Resources allocated using ordinary C memory allocation functions are not
    automatically freed in the presence of direct exceptions. See section
    @href{Direct exceptions and freeing resources} for a more detailed
    discussion.
</ul>

@h2 Using file operations

<p>Basic C file operations such as <tt>printf</tt>, <tt>fopen</tt> and
<tt>read</tt> can be used in Alore C libraries, but the following issues
should be addressed:

<ul>
  <li>When writing to standard output using C functions, you must first
    flush the corresponding Alore stream @ref{io::StdOut}. After having
    written data to stdout, you must flush the C stream, for example by using
    <tt>fflush</tt>. Otherwise output may not appear in the expected order.
  <li>When reading from stdin using both the Alore @ref{io::StdIn} stream and
    the C stdin stream, buffering may cause unexpected behavior, since both of
    the stream implementations have independent and separate buffering
    mechanisms.
</ul>

@h2 Performing blocking or long-running operations

<p>Long-running or blocking C calls, for example file input/output, need
to be surrounded with @ref{AAllowBlocking} and @ref{AEndBlocking} macros.
