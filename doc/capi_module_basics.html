@title Module basics

<p>This section discusses several basic issues related to defining modules,
including the top-level module macros and importing other modules.

@h2 Definition block start and end macros

<p>
@indexitem A_MODULE
Use the A_MODULE macro to start the module definition block:

@example
  A_MODULE(modulename, "modulename")
@end

<p>The arguments contain the module name, first unquoted and then in quotes.
If a multipart module name such as foo::bar is used, however, the first
argument should have the :: operators replaced with underscores like this:

@example
  A_MODULE(foo_bar, "foo::bar")
@end

<p>The value of the first argument is also used in the name of the compiled
module (foo_bar.so or foo_bar.dll in the above example).

<p>
@indexitem A_END_MODULE
The A_END_MODULE macro must be used to signal the end of the module
definition block, after all the definitions. This example illustrates the
structure of a module definition, with various details omitted:

@example
  A_MODULE(...)
      /* contents of the module defined using various A_* macros */
      A_DEF(...)
      A_CLASS(...)
          A_VAR(...)
          A_METHOD(...)
          A_METHOD(...)
      A_END_CLASS()
      A_DEF(...)
      ...
  A_END_MODULE()
@end

@h2 Importing modules

<p>
@indexitem A_IMPORT
Like ordinary modules implemented in Alore, C modules may import other
modules. The A_IMPORT macro is used for this purpose:

@example
  A_MODULE(example, "example")
      A_IMPORT("re")
      /* contents of the module */
  A_END_MODULE()
@end

<p>C modules may import both C and Alore modules, but circular dependencies
are limited: there must be no circular dependencies between any two C modules.

<p>A circular dependency between an Alore and a C module, however, is possible.
It is actually a common implementation technique for creating effectively mixed
C/Alore modules, as explained in section @href{Mixing Alore and C in modules}.

<h3>Visibility of global definitions</h3>

<p>Unlike in Alore code, C modules may access both public and private global
definitions in all modules that are imported anywhere in the program.
The A_IMPORT macro therefore does not
affect the visibility of definitions. The macro is still important, however,
since it ensures that the imported module is loaded into memory &#8212; if
a module is never imported in a program, any definitions defined in it are not
accessible at all. This affects several API functions, including but not
limited to @ref{AGlobal} and @ref{ACall}.

<p>As an exception, the module that defines the target type of
the @ref{A_INHERIT}
macro must be explicitly imported (unless the superclass is defined in
the std or the current module).
