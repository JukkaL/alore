@title Overview of static and dynamic typing

<p>Alore is a programming language that supports both dynamic and static
typing, and a mixture of both in the same program.
This section gives an overview of some central issues related to static typing.
We also discuss when to use static types, how static
typing differs from dynamic typing, and why it can be very useful to have
both static and dynamic typing available at the same time.

<p>A dynamically-typed variable can hold values of any type (e.g. integers,
strings or arrays). Operations on dynamically-typed variables are checked at
runtime. In a dynamically-typed program all (or most) variables are dynamically
typed.

<p>Statically-typed variables are declared to hold values of a specific type.
When using static typing, a program is type checked before running it.
Type checking verifies that
operations on a value are valid for the type of the value.
For example, trying to add a string
to an integer results in a type check error in a statically-typed program.
In a dynamically-typed program the error would be caught only at runtime, and
only when that particular operation would be performed.

<p>This document assumes that the reader has a working knowledge of the
dynamically-typed subset of Alore and the standard
library, in particular the <tt>std</tt> module. It is sufficient to
be familiar with the content of <a href="intro.html">Introduction to Alore</a>.
This document focuses on the type system
and does not repeat information in the linked general introduction.

<p>It is helpful if the reader has a basic understanding of programming in
a statically-typed language such as Java, C++ or C#.

<h2>A static typing example</h2>

<p>In this section we present a small example program using both dynamic and
static typing, and discuss their differences.

<p>The following dynamically-typed program approximates two triangles using
ASCII characters:

@example
  def Triangle(n, ch)
    for y in 0 to n
      WriteLn(ch * (y + 1))
    end
  end
  Triangle(2, '*')
  Triangle(4, '\')
@end

<p>The output from the program looks like this:

@example
  *
  **
  \
  \\
  \\\
  \\\\
@end

<p>We can modify the program to be statically-typed by declaring
the types of some variables. The <tt>as</tt> keyword is used to introduce
these type annotations (we highlight all changes):

@example
  def Triangle(n <span class="hiliexample">as Int</span>, ch <span class="hiliexample">as Str</span>)
    for y in 0 to n
      WriteLn(ch * (y + 1))
    end
  end
  Triangle(2, '*')
  Triangle(4, '\')
@end

<p>The annotations declare that <tt>Triangle</tt> must be called with a
first argument that is an integer and a second argument that is a string.
The annotations also
declare the types of the arguments within the function body.
The type of the local variable <tt>y</tt>
is <i>inferred</i> to be <tt>Int</tt>. The output of the function remains
identical to the dynamically-typed version.

<p>We can also specify the type of <tt>y</tt> explicitly, by replacing the
second line of the example with the line below:

@example
  for y <span class="hiliexample">as Int</span> in 0 to n
@end

<p>Now let's add a new line to the end of both of the program variants:

@example
  ...
  Triangle(2, '*')
  Triangle(4, '\')
  <span class="hiliexample">Triangle(3, 3)</span>
@end

<p>The dynamically-typed program still produces some output, but perhaps not
what we'd expect (and without reporting a problem):

@example
  *
  **
  \
  \\
  \\\
  \\\\
  <span class="hiliexample">1
  3
  9</span>
@end

<p>However, static type checking produces the following error when type
checking the statically-typed program variant:

@example
  program2.alo, line 8: Argument 2 to "Triangle" has incompatible type "Int"
@end

<p>Let's do another modification:

@example
  ...
  Triangle(2, '*')
  Triangle(4, '\')
  <span class="hiliexample">Triangle('#', 3)</span>
@end

<p>Note that the arguments in the third call are in reverse order.
Now the dynamically-typed program terminates with a runtime type error
after producing some output:

@example
  *
  **
  \
  \\
  \\\
  \\\\
  <span class="hiliexample">Traceback (most recent call last):
    at main level (program3.alo, line 8)
    Triangle (program3.alo, line 2)
  TypeError: Non-integer Range upper bound (Str)</span>
@end

<p>Static type checking again detects the above error without having to run the
program:

@example
  program3.alo, line 8: Argument 1 to "Triangle" has incompatible type "Str"
  program3.alo, line 8: Argument 2 to "Triangle" has incompatible type "Int"
@end

<p>The above examples highlight some of the differences between dynamic and
static typing, although many details were omitted. The next section discusses
the differences more broadly.

<h2>Why both static <i>and</i> dynamic typing?</h2>

<p>At the present,
almost all programming programming languages support only static
or dynamic typing, or they clearly favor one of them. Alore is different in
having excellent support for both of them. The philosophy of Alore is based on
the observation that both dynamic and static typing are useful, but in
different circumstances. These circumstances are always changing and difficult
to predict, and it is
undesirable to have to restrict oneself to one particular way. Alore gives
the flexibility of choosing when static or dynamic typing is the right
alternative, and the
ability to switch between these when circumstances change.
Alore does this without the hassle of
having to support two different programming languages, with their different
syntaxes, idioms, libraries and tools.

<p>Dynamic and static typing have different costs and benefits. Picking the
best one for a particular task is not always easy.

<p>Static typing has the following main benefits:

    <ul>
      <li>It allows statically (without running the program)
        detecting many programming errors quickly,
        reliably and automatically. This helps reduce the number of bugs and
        reduces the time spent on debugging.
      <li>Type declarations serve as automatically-checked documentation.
        They make programs easier to understand and maintain.
      <li>Static typing may improve runtime efficiency.
        (Note that the Alore runtime cannot currently take advantage of
         type declarations, but this will likely change in the future.)
      </ul>

<p>Dynamic typing has a different, complementary set of benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic typing is conceptually simpler and easier to understand
        than static typing, especially with a relatively powerful static type
        system such as the one in Alore.
        This effect is pronounced for non-expert programmers.
      <li>Dynamic typing is more flexible. A static
        type system always restricts what
        can be conveniently expressed. Programming with a static
        type system often requires more design and implementation effort.
      <li>Dynamic typing results in more compact programs, since it is more
        flexible and does not require types to be spelled out.
    </ul>

<p>The benefits of static typing are more pronounced for large and
    complex programs. It offers few advantages over dynamic typing in many
    scenarios (e.g. scripting and prototyping). In these cases it can mainly
    slow down the programmer, and dynamic typing is preferable.

<h2>Features of Alore type system</h2>

<p>The list below presents some of the main features of the Alore type system.
The rest of this document introduces these features in more detail:

<ul>
  <li>Alore supports <i>generic types</i> and <i>generic functions</i>. Generic
    types with parameters are most commonly used for collection types, e.g.
    <tt>Array&lt;Int&gt;</tt> for an array of integers.
    User-defined types can be generic.
  <li>The type system supports <i>type inference</i> for local variables and
    generic
    type parameters. This greatly simplifies working with generic types.
  <li>Alore allows arbitrary mixing of dynamic and static typing within a
    program:
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamically-typed code may use statically-typed libraries and
        vice versa, without restriction.
      <li>Dynamically-typed classes may inherit statically-typed classes
        and vice versa.
      <li>Dynamic and static types can be mixed within a single function,
        a class or an expression.
    </ul>
  <li>Alore has <i>tuple types</i> and functions types. For example,
    the 2-item tuple
    <tt>(2, 'x')</tt> has type <tt>(Int, Str)</tt>.
  <li>Interface types allow a simple form of multiple inheritance.
    Retroactive definition of interfaces for existing types is possible,
    and even for built-in types such as <tt>Int</tt> or <tt>Str</tt>.
  <li>Alore has a <i>quasi-optional type system</i>: declared types cannot
    arbitrarily change the behavior of programs. This allows selectively
    ignoring types when running programs, which makes it possible to run and
    debug programs with static type errors in them.
    It also makes it straightforward to evolve
    dynamically-typed programs to use static typing.
  <li>Alore models function overloading by using <i>intersection types</i>.
    Unlike ordinary <i>static function overloading</i>, this is compatible
    with a quasi-optional type system.
</ul>
