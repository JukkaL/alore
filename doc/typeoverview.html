@title Overview of static and dynamic typing

<p>Alore is a programming language that supports both dynamic and static
typing, and a mixture of both in the same program.
This section gives an overview of some central issues related to static typing.
We also discuss when to use static types, how static
typing differs from dynamic typing, and why it can be very useful to have
both static and dynamic typing available at the same time.

<p>A dynamically-typed variable can hold values of any type (e.g. integers,
strings or arrays). Operations on dynamically-typed variables are checked at
runtime. In a dynamically-typed program all (or most) variables are dynamically
typed.

<p>Statically-typed variables are declared to hold values of a specific type.
When using static typing, a program is type checked before running it.
Type checking verifies that
operations on a value are valid for the type of the value.
For example, trying to add a string
to an integer results in a type check error in a statically-typed program.
In a dynamically-typed program the error would be caught only at runtime, and
only when that particular operation would be performed.

<p>This document assumes that the reader has a working knowledge of the
dynamically-typed subset of Alore and the standard
library, in particular the <tt>std</tt> module. It is sufficient to
be familiar with the content of <a href="intro.html">Introduction to Alore</a>.
This document focuses on the type system
and does not repeat information in the linked general introduction.

<p>It is helpful if the reader has a basic understanding of programming in
a statically-typed language such as Java, C++ or C#.

@h2 A static typing example

<p>In this section we present a small example program using both dynamic and
static typing, and discuss their differences.

<p>The following dynamically-typed program approximates two triangles using
ASCII characters:

@example
  def Triangle(n, ch)
    for y in 0 to n
      WriteLn(ch * (y + 1))
    end
  end
  Triangle(2, '*')
  Triangle(4, '\')
@end

<p>Now let's save the program as <tt>program.alo</tt> and run the program.
The output looks like this:

@example
  $ <b>alore program.alo</b>
  *
  **
  \
  \\
  \\\
  \\\\
@end

<h3>Declaring types</h3>

<p>We can modify the program to be statically-typed by declaring
the types of some variables. The <tt>as</tt> keyword is used to introduce
these type annotations (we highlight all changes):

@example
  def Triangle(n {{{as Int}}}, ch {{{as Str}}})
    for y in 0 to n
      WriteLn(ch * (y + 1))
    end
  end
  Triangle(2, '*')
  Triangle(4, '\')
@end

<p>The annotations declare that <tt>Triangle</tt> must be called with a
first argument that is an integer and a second argument that is a string.
The annotations also
declare the types of the arguments within the function body.
The type of the local variable <tt>y</tt>
is <i>inferred</i> to be <tt>Int</tt>. The output of the function remains
identical to the dynamically-typed version.

<p>We can also specify the type of <tt>y</tt> explicitly, by replacing the
second line of the example with the line below:

@example
  for y {{{as Int}}} in 0 to n
@end

<h3>Running the type checker</h3>

<p>If you save the modified program as <tt>program2.alo</tt>, you can now type
check it by running <tt>alore</tt> with the <tt>-c</tt> option:

@example
  $ <b>alore -c program2.alo</b>
  $
@end

<p>There were no type errors since there was no output from the type checker.
You can type check the program and also run it (if there are no errors) with
the <tt>-t</tt> option:

@example
  $ <b>alore -t program2.alo</b>
  *
  **
  \
  \\
  ...
@end

<h3>Introducing type errors</h3>

<p>Now let's add a new line to the end of both of the program variants:

@example
  ...
  Triangle(2, '*')
  Triangle(4, '\')
  {{{Triangle(3, 3)}}}
@end

<p>The dynamically-typed program still produces some output, but perhaps not
what we'd expect (and without reporting a problem):

@example
  $ <b>alore program.alo</b>
  *
  **
  \
  \\
  \\\
  \\\\
  {{{1
  3
  9}}}
@end

<p>However, static type checking produces the following error when type
checking the statically-typed program variant:

@example
  $ <b>alore -c program2.alo</b>
  program2.alo, line 8: Argument 2 to "Triangle" has incompatible type "Int"
@end

<p>Let's do another modification:

@example
  ...
  Triangle(2, '*')
  Triangle(4, '\')
  {{{Triangle('#', 3)}}}
@end

<p>Note that the arguments in the third call are in reverse order.
Now the dynamically-typed program terminates with a runtime type error
after producing some output:

@example
  $ <b>alore program3.alo</b>
  *
  **
  \
  \\
  \\\
  \\\\
  {{{Traceback (most recent call last):
    at main level (program3.alo, line 8)
    Triangle (program3.alo, line 2)
  TypeError: Non-integer Range upper bound (Str)}}}
@end

<p>Static type checking again detects the above error without having to run the
program:

@example
  $ <b>alore -c program4.alo</b>
  program4.alo, line 8: Argument 1 to "Triangle" has incompatible type "Str"
  program4.alo, line 8: Argument 2 to "Triangle" has incompatible type "Int"
@end

<p>The above examples highlight some of the differences between dynamic and
static typing, although many details were omitted. The next section discusses
the differences more broadly.

@note Since Alore has an <i>optional</i> type system, you can always run
      programs that have type check errors. Simply omit the <tt>-c</tt> or
      <tt>-t</tt> option,
      and the interpreter will skip all type declarations. This can be very
      useful in the middle of a large program modification. It is nice to be
      able to debug a program with potentially hundreds of type errors in it,
      instead of being forced to wait until no type errors remain.
@end

@h2 Why both static and dynamic typing?

<p>At the present,
almost all programming programming languages support only static
or dynamic typing, or they clearly favor one of them. Alore is different in
having excellent support for both of them. The philosophy of Alore is based on
the observation that both dynamic and static typing are useful, but in
different circumstances. These circumstances are always changing and difficult
to predict, and it is
undesirable to have to restrict oneself to one particular way. Alore gives
the flexibility of choosing when static or dynamic typing is the right
alternative, and the
ability to switch between these when circumstances change.
Alore does this without the hassle of
having to support two different programming languages, with their different
syntaxes, idioms, libraries and tools.

<p>Dynamic and static typing have different costs and benefits. Picking the
best one for a particular task is not always easy.

<p>Static typing has the following main benefits:

    <ul>
      <li>It allows statically (without running the program)
        detecting many programming errors quickly,
        reliably and automatically. This helps reduce the number of bugs and
        reduces the time spent on debugging.
      <li>Type declarations serve as automatically-checked documentation.
        They make programs easier to understand and maintain.
      <li>Static typing may improve runtime efficiency.
        (Note that the Alore runtime cannot currently take advantage of
         type declarations, but this will likely change in the future.)
      </ul>

<p>Dynamic typing has a different, complementary set of benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic typing is conceptually simpler and easier to understand
        than static typing, especially when using powerful container types
        such as Alore arrays, tuples and maps.
        This effect is pronounced for non-expert programmers.
      <li>Dynamic typing is more flexible. A static
        type system always restricts what
        can be conveniently expressed. Programming with a static
        type system often requires more design and implementation effort.
      <li>Dynamic typing results in more compact programs, since it is more
        flexible and does not require types to be spelled out.
    </ul>

<p>The benefits of static typing are more pronounced for large and
    complex programs. It offers little benefit over dynamic typing when
    writing short scripts and prototypes, for example. In these cases it mainly
    slows down the programmer, and dynamic typing is preferable.

@h2 Features of Alore type system

<p>The list below presents some of the main features of the Alore type system.
The rest of this document introduces these features in more detail:

<ul>
  <li>Alore allows arbitrary mixing of dynamic and static typing within a
    program:
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamically-typed code may use statically-typed libraries and
        vice versa, without restriction.
      <li>Dynamically-typed classes may inherit statically-typed classes
        and vice versa.
      <li>Dynamic and static types can be mixed within a single function,
        a class or an expression.
    </ul>
  <li>Alore supports <i>generic types</i> and <i>generic functions</i>. Generic
    types with parameters are most commonly used for collection types, e.g.
    <tt>Array&lt;Int&gt;</tt> for an array of integers.
    User-defined types can be generic.
  <li>The type system supports <i>type inference</i> for local variables and
    generic
    type parameters. This greatly simplifies working with generic types.
  <li>Alore has <i>tuple types</i> and functions types. For example,
    the 2-item tuple
    <tt>(2, 'x')</tt> has type <tt>(Int, Str)</tt>.
  <li>Interface types allow a simple form of multiple inheritance.
    Retroactive definition of interfaces for existing types is possible,
    and even for built-in types such as <tt>Int</tt> or <tt>Str</tt>,
    using <tt>bind</tt> declarations.
  <li>Alore has an <i>optional type system</i>: declared types cannot
    arbitrarily change the behavior of programs. This allows selectively
    ignoring types when running programs, which makes it possible to run and
    debug programs with static type errors in them.
    It also enables smooth evolution from
    dynamically-typed programs to static typing.
  <li>Alore models function overloading by using <i>intersection types</i>.
    Unlike ordinary <i>static function overloading</i>, this is compatible
    with an optional type system.
</ul>

@h2 More examples

<p>The Alore distribution includes several example programs that show how
to use static typing. Here are a few:

<ul>
  <li><tt>demo/cgi/wiki.alo</tt> (a simple wiki application)
  <li><tt>demo/classes/complex/complex.alo</tt> (a complex number class)
  <li><tt>demo/scripts/wordfreq.alo</tt> (a text file analysis script)
</ul>

<p>If you feel more adventurous, you can also have a look at Alore standard
library module sources (under <tt>lib/</tt>) and the Alore type checker
(under <tt>check/</tt>).
