@title Comparison operations

<p>These API functions perform operations that are equivalent to using
Alore comparison operators such as == and &lt;. Therefore they support multiple
operand types and operator overloading, in a similar fashion to the Alore
operators.

<p>Each of these functions returns an int:

<ul>
  <li>1 if the comparison was true
  <li>0 if the comparison was false
  <li>a negative value if a normal exception was raised.
</ul>

<p>All of these functions may raise direct or normal exceptions.

@fun int AIsEq(AThread *t, AValue a, AValue b)
@desc Perform the comparison operation a == b.
@end

@fun int  AIsNeq(AThread *t, AValue a, AValue b)
@desc Perform the comparison operation a != b.
@end

@fun int AIsLt(AThread *t, AValue a, AValue b)
@desc Perform the comparison operation a &lt; b.
@end

@fun int AIsGt(AThread *t, AValue a, AValue b)
@desc Perform the comparison operation a &gt; b.
@end

@fun int AIsGte(AThread *t, AValue a, AValue b)
@desc Perform the comparison operation a &gt;= b.
@end

@fun int AIsLte(AThread *t, AValue a, AValue b)
@desc Perform the comparison operation a &lt;= b.
@end
