@title <tt>math</tt>: Mathematical functions

<p>This module contains several basic mathematical functions and a few numeric
constants.
All operations are implemented using floating point arithmetic, and all
functions return <tt>Float</tt> values. Functions accept integer arguments in
addition to floats, but integer arguments are converted to floats internally.
The argument types below only include <tt>Float</tt> for conciseness.

<p>All angles are in radians.

<h2>Functions</h2>

@fun Sqrt(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return the square root of <i>x</i>.
@end

@fun Sin(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return the sine of <i>x</i>.
@end

@fun Cos(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return the cosine of <i>x</i>.
@end

@fun Tan(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return the tangent of <i>x</i>.
@end

@fun ArcSin(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return the arc sine of <i>x</i>.
@end

@fun ArcCos(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return the arc cosine of <i>x</i>.
@end

@fun ArcTan(y as Float[, x as Float]) as Float
@desc Return the arc tangent of <i>y</i> or <i>y / x</i>. If <i>x</i> is 
      negative, the magnitude of the result will be chosen to be 
      between <tt>Pi</tt> / 2 and <tt>Pi</tt>; otherwise,
      the magnitude of the result is at most <tt>Pi</tt> / 2.
@end

@fun Ceil(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return <i>x</i> rounded up to the nearest integer.
@end

@fun Floor(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return <i>x</i> rounded down to the nearest integer.
@end

@fun Round(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return <i>x</i> rounded to the nearest integer.
@end

@fun Trunc(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return <i>x</i> rounded to the nearest integer towards zero.
@end

@fun Exp(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return <i>e</i>**<i>x</i>.
@end

@fun Log(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return the natural logarithm of <i>x</i>.<br>
    @note The logarithm in base <i>y</i> can be calculated as
      <tt>Log(x)</tt> / <tt>Log(y)</tt>.
    @end
@end

@fun IsInf(x as Float) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether <i>x</i> is IEEE 754 positive or
      negative infinity.
@end

@fun IsNaN(x as Float) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether <i>x</i> is IEEE 754 NaN
      (Not-a-Number).
@end

<h2>Constants</h2>

@var Pi as Float
@desc The constant <i>pi</i>, approximately 3.14159.
@end

@var E as Float
@desc The constant <i>e</i>, approximately 2.71828.
@end
