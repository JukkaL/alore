@title Implicit interfaces

<p>A few implicit interfaces are referred to in Alore documentation. They are
described in this section. Note that an object (or type) may support multiple
implicit interfaces. Note that implicit interfaces are often called simply
interfaces.

<h2>Sequence</h2>

@class-hidden Sequence

<p>An object supports the read-only sequence interface if it supports
the following operations:

@fun length()
@desc Return the length of the sequence.
@end

@op sequence[n]
@desc Return the element at the specified index. The first element has index 0,
      the second 1, etc.
      @note Negative index values need not be supported.
      @end
@end

<p>Mutable sequences support assigning to an index as well. It is valid to
refer to the sequence interface without specifying whether the sequence is
read-only or mutable. The exact kind should, however, be obvious from context.

<p>@ref{Array} objects are mutable sequences and @ref{Str} objects are
immutable sequences.

<h2>Iterable</h2>

@class-hidden Iterable

<p>Iterable objects provide the <tt>iterator</tt> method:

@fun iterator()
@desc Return an iterator that iterates over all the objects in a composite
      object.
@end

<p>@ref{Str}, @ref{Range}, @ref{Array}, @ref{Map}, @ref{Set} and @ref{Stream}
objects are iterable.

<h2>Iterator</h2>

@class-hidden Iterator

<p>An object that supports the iterator interface allows iterating over the
items of a composite object. It provides these methods:

@fun hasNext()
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether there are additional objects in the
      iteration.
@end

@fun next()
@desc Return the next object in the iteration. The iterator interface
      does not specify the order in which objects are returned, but many
      iterable types, such as @ref{Array}, guarantee a specific iteration
      order.
@end
