@title Interfaces

<p>The <tt>std</tt> module defines several interfaces. They are
described in this section. Note that a class may implement multiple
interfaces. 

<h2>Interface <tt>Sequence&LT;T&gt;</tt></h2>

@class-hidden Sequence

<p>An object that implements <tt>Sequence</tt> can be used as a read-only
sequence. The interface includes the following operations:

@fun length() as Int
@desc Return the length of the sequence.
@end

@op sequence[n] @optype{Sequence<T>[Int] -> T}
@desc Return the element at the specified index. The first element has index 0,
      the second 1, etc.
      @note Negative index values need not be supported.
      @end
@end

<p>@ref{Array} and @ref{Str} implement <tt>Sequence</tt>. Note that
<tt>Array</tt> objects are mutable.

<h2>Interface <tt>Iterable&lt;T&gt;</tt></h2>

@class-hidden Iterable

<p>Iterable objects provide the <tt>iterator</tt> method:

@fun iterator() as Iterator<T>
@desc Return an iterator that iterates over all the objects in a composite
      object.
@end

<p>@ref{Str}, @ref{Range}, @ref{Array}, @ref{Map}, @ref{Set} and @ref{Stream}
objects implement <tt>Iterable</tt>.

<h2>Interface <tt>Iterator&lt;T&gt;</tt></h2>

@class-hidden Iterator

<p>An object that supports the <tt>Iterator</tt> interface performs an
iteration over the items of a composite object. It provides these methods:

@fun hasNext() as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether there are additional objects in the
      iteration.
@end

@fun next() as T
@desc Return the next object in the iteration. The iterator interface
      does not specify the order in which objects are returned, but many
      iterable types, such as @ref{Array}, guarantee a specific iteration
      order.
@end

<h2>Interface <tt>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</tt></h2>

@class-hidden Comparable

@op o < x @optype{Comparable<T> < T -> Boolean}
@op o > x @optype{Comparable<T> > T -> Boolean}
@desc A <tt>Comparable</tt> object supports comparisons using &lt; and &gt;.
@end

<h2>Interface <tt>Addable&lt;OT, RT&gt;</tt></h2>

@class-hidden Addable

@op o + x @optype{Multipliable<OT, RT> + OT -> RT}
@desc An instance that implements <tt>Addable</tt> supports the
      + operation. The operand and result types depend are derived from the
      type arguments.
@end

<h2>Interface <tt>Multipliable&lt;OT, RT&gt;</tt></h2>

@class-hidden Multipliable

@op o * x @optype{Multipliable<OT, RT> * OT -> RT}
@desc An instance that implements <tt>Multipliable</tt> supports the
      * operation. The operand and result types depend are derived from the
      type arguments.
@end
