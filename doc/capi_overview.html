@title Overview

<p>The Alore C API can be used to implement modules accessible to
Alore programs in C or C++. By implementing modules in C you can access
existing C libraries. This is the most common reason for using C modules,
but a C module can also be used to improve the execution speed of many
operations compared to a pure Alore implementation.

<p>The Alore C API allows doing essentially everything that is possible in
Alore code. You could also do many things that have no direct equivalents in
Alore, but some of these are disallowed and are only a result of the less
strict error checking performed by the C API.

<p>You should, however, be aware the following issues before beginning to write
a module in C:

<ul>
  <li>Implementing the same functionality in Alore C API typically requires
    much more work than writing similar functionality in Alore. Of course,
    sometimes it is not possible to implement some piece of code using only
    Alore code. In a case like that, you should consider writing the simplest
    possible C extension module and an Alore wrapper module that provides a
    simplified or higher level interface to the C module, and implementing all
    the functionality that is not strictly required to be implemented in C
    in Alore.
  <li>C modules have less protection from programming errors. They can
    easily leak memory, cause memory corruption or break Alore language
    semantics, if not used with care.
  <li>C modules typically have to be compiled separately for each supported
    platform. In addition, writing portable C code can be difficult.
  <li>Besides requiring more work, writing C extension modules is usually
    simply much more difficult than writing comparable Alore code. To do
    anything non-trivial, you need to have pretty good C skills and be very
    careful.
  <li>Some things might be slower in C than in Alore code, for example
    performing Alore arithmetic operations.
    Try to do as much as possible using standard low-level C operations,
    since Alore C API functions might be slow.
</ul>

<p>In a nutshell, always consider if Alore code might be good enough: write it
in Alore unless there is a very compelling reason to do otherwise.
