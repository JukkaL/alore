@title Introduction

<p>The Alore standard library provides many useful services that you can use in
your programs. This reference manual contains descriptions of all standard
Alore modules. If you are just starting to learn Alore, start with
<a href="intro.html">Introduction to Alore</a>. It contains a short overview of
the standard library. After that, come back to this document for the details.

@h2 Notation

<p>This section gives an overview of the notation used in the library
reference.

<h3>Type declarations</h3>

<p>Descriptions of functions, types and variables usually include type
declarations. For example, consider the definition of function @ref{std::Chr}:

@fun Chr(n as Int) as Str
@desc Return a ...
@end

<p>The function header indicates that <tt>Chr</tt> accepts a single integer
argument (due to <tt>as Int</tt>), and it returns a string
(due to <tt>as Str</tt>).

<p>Container types such <tt>Array</tt> have a type argument (or arguments)
within <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt> that indicates
the type of items; for example <tt>Array&lt;Str&gt;</tt> stands for an array of
integers, and <tt>Map&lt;Int, Str&gt;</tt> stands for a map from integers to
strings.

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>The type signatures of operations involving operators such as
<tt>+</tt>, <tt>*</tt> or <tt>[]</tt>
use a special notation for clarity.
For example, consider the + operation for strings:

@op x + y @optype{Str + Str -> Str}
@desc Return the concatenation of two strings.
@end

<p>This means that you can add two string objects, and the result is a string.
The first part (<tt>x + y</tt>) indicates the kind of the operation, and the
second part indicates the types of the operands and the result
(<tt>Str + Str &rArr; Str</tt>).
The actual implementation method can be derived from the above description;
in this case it is <tt>_add</tt> (the base type is <tt>Str</tt>):

@fun _add(y as Str) as Str
@end

<p>Indexed array assignment is a more complex example:

@op array[n] = x @optype{Array<T>[Int] = T}

<p>Again the left part tells us that this is an indexed assignment operation.
The second part says that if the base object has type <tt>Array&lt;T&gt;</tt>
(for any T), and if the index has type <tt>Int</tt>, the rvalue must have
type <tt>T</tt> (or any type that is compatible with T). We know that
T can be replaced with any type from the definition of
<a href="std_array.html"><tt>Array</tt></a>: it is
given as <tt>Array&lt;T&gt;</tt>, which tells that T is a <i>type variable</i>.

<h3>Multiple function signatures</h3>

<p>If a function or an operation is given multiple descriptions or signatures,
it has an
<a href="intersectiontypes.html">intersection type</a> (which is similar to
function overloading in other languages). For example,
@ref{std::Abs} has two signatures:

@fun Abs(x as Int) as Int
@fun Abs(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return the absolute value of an integer or a float.
@end

<p>It is not important to understand the details of intersection types to
use these kinds of functions or operations.
