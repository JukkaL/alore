@title <tt>http</tt>: HTTP client

<p>This module implements a simple HTTP client.

<p>Here is a short example of making a HTTP GET request:

@example
  var h = Http("www.example.com")
  h.request("GET", "/index.html")
  var r = h.response()
  r.status                     -- 200
  r.reason                     -- "OK"
  r.headers["content-length"]  -- "438"
  r.readLn()                   -- "&lt;HTML&gt;" (first line of response body)
  r.read()                     -- "&lt;HEAD&gt;..." (rest of the body)
  h.close()
@end

<p>Refer to the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">HTTP 1.1
specification</a> (RFC 2616) for a detailed description of the HTTP protocol.

<h2>Class <tt>Http</tt></h2>

@class Http(host as Str[, port as Int])
@desc Construct a HTTP connection object that connects to the specified host.
      Port 80 is used by default. The optional port argument can be used to
      override this. If this call returns successfully, a TCP connection has
      been established with the host.
@end

<h3><tt>Http</tt> methods</h3>

@fun request(method as Str, url as Str[, headers as Array<Pair<Str, Str>>[, body as Str]])
@desc Send a request to the HTTP connection. The <tt>method</tt> argument
      must be a
      valid HTTP method (e.g., "GET" or "POST"). The <tt>url</tt> argument
      defines the resource to be fetched.
      <p>The optional <tt>headers</tt> argument should be a
      sequence of name/value
      pairs. These are additional headers that will be sent to the server as
      part of the request. Note that the Host header is automatically sent and
      should not be included in the headers argument.
      <p>The <tt>body</tt> argument is the request body that will sent to the
      server. It can be any narrow string. If the body is non-empty,
      the Content-Length header is automatically set.
@end

@fun response() as HttpResponse
@desc Return the response from the server to the oldest sent request as a
      @ref{HttpResponse} object.
      Note that you must either read any previous responses entirely or close
      them before calling <tt>response</tt> again for the same connection.
@end

@fun close()
@desc Close the connection and release any allocated system resources. You must
      call this method for every connection, even if <tt>isOpen</tt> returns
      <tt>False</tt>.
      <p>Input operations made on @ref{HttpResponse} objects related to this
      connection will fail with @ref{IoError} when the connection is closed.
@end

@fun isOpen() as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating if additional requests can be passed to the
      server using this connection. You must have called <tt>response</tt>
      before calling <tt>isOpen</tt>.
@end

@fun auth(username as Str, password as Str)
@desc Specify the username and password to be used with the following requests
      performed using this connection. Only HTTP basic authentication is
      supported.
      @note The username and password are passed as plaintext and thus can
            potentially be eavesdropped.
      @end
@end

<h2>Class <tt>HttpResponse</tt></h2>

@inherits Stream
@supertypes

@class-hidden HttpResponse

<p>This class represents a single response stream from a HTTP server.
It inherits from @ref{io::Stream} and supports all stream input
operations. It is instantiated by the <tt>Http</tt> class.

<p>Note that you do not generally need to close <tt>HttpResponse</tt> streams.

<p>In addition, it defines the following constant members:

@var headers as HttpHeaders
@desc HTTP headers associated with the response an an instance of the Map-like
      @ref{HttpHeaders} class.
@end

@var status as Int
@desc Integer status code of the response. The status codes are described
      in the HTTP specification.
@end

@var reason as Str
@desc Reason phrase returned by the server.
@end

@var version as Str
@desc HTTP version used by the server for this response. It is typically
      "1.1" or "1.0".
@end

<h2>Class <tt>HttpHeaders</tt></h2>

@inherits Map
@supertypes

@class-hidden HttpHeaders

<p>This class implements an immutable map where keys are strings and are
matched ignoring case. It inherits from @ref{Map}. You should not construct
<tt>HttpHeader</tt> instances by directly calling the constructor.

<p><tt>HttpHeaders</tt> objects are used to access HTTP response headers:

@example
  r = conn.response()
  r.headers.hasKey("content-length")   -- Does the header exist?
  r.headers["Content-Type"]            -- Value of the Content-Type header
                                       -- Note: case does not matter
  r.headers.keys()                     -- Array of defined header names
@end

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

@class HttpError([message as Str])
@desc This exception is raised on HTTP-specific error conditions. It inherits
      from @ref{IoError}.
@end

@end-class

<h2>Constants</h2>

@var HttpPort as Int
@desc The default HTTP port (80).
@end

<h2>Functions</h2>

@fun DefaultProxy() as (Str, Int)
@desc Return a tuple (url, port) if a default HTTP proxy is defined using the
      <tt>http_proxy</tt> environment variable. The url is a string and
      the port is an integer. Return <tt>nil</tt> if no
      proxy is defined.
@end
