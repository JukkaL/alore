@title Program structure

@h2 Main module

<p>Each program has a single main source file. The main source file contains 
an optional UTF-8 byte order mark sequence, an optional <tt>#!</tt> comment,
an optional encoding declaration, any number of import declarations, and any
number of global definitions and statements:

@grammar
  main :: [ utf8-bom ] [ initial-comment newline ] [ br] [ encoding-decl ] imports defs
@end

<p>The definitions (and statements) in the main source file form the
<i>main module</i>. This module has the following special characteristics:

<ul>
<li>It has no name. Therefore, it cannot be imported in other modules.
<li>It is the <i>root</i> module, i.e. the only module in a program that is
  not imported by another module.
<li>It always contains a single file (the main source file). Other modules may
  contain multiple source files.
</ul>

<p>To avoid confusion, the term <i>module</i> as used below does not refer to
the main module, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.

@h2 Modules

<p>A module contains one or more source files. Modules are identified by names
that are formed by joining one or more identifiers (components) with the
<tt>::</tt> operator. Each module source file
contains an optional encoding declaration, a module declaration,
import declarations, followed by global definitions and statements:

@grammar
  module :: [ utf8-bom ] [ encoding-decl ] module-decl imports defs
  module-decl :: "module" module-name br
  module-name :: id ("::" id)*
@end

<p>The tokens after the <tt>module</tt> keyword must form the module name.

<p>The relative location of the module files is formed by interpreting the
module name components as directory names. The first component is the main 
directory, the second component is the subdirectory of the main directory, etc.
The root directory that contains the main directory is the directory of the
main source file, but implementations may define other, alternative root
directories for the standard modules and for other purposes.

@h2 Import declarations

<p>An import declaration makes public definitions in one or more modules
available within a source file:

@grammar
  imports :: ("import" module-name ("," module-name)* br)*
@end

<p>It also causes the modules to be parsed and compiled. Modules that are not
imported are not compiled, and thus any errors in them are not reported.

<p>It is an error to import a module twice in the same source file.

@h2 The std module

<p>The special module @ref{std} contains definitions of basic types,
exceptions and other objects that are generally useful in many Alore 
programs. This module is always implicitly imported in every source file, and 
it is an error to import it explicitly.

@h2 Standard modules

<p>All modules defined in the <a href="libmain.html">Alore Library
Reference</a> are standard modules, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.
There are no other standard modules. Every Alore implementation should provide
all the standard modules. If it does not provide some of them, or if the
module implementations are incomplete, this should be clearly mentioned in the 
accompanying documentation.
  
<p>Standard modules may define additional public global definitions and members
beyond those described in the Alore Library Reference. The names
of these definitions always start with two underscores (__).
Otherwise, standard modules define only those public names that are mentioned 
in the Alore Library Reference. New versions of Alore may define additional
functionality in standard library modules. An implementation should make clear
which version of the Alore standard library it implements.

@h2 Encoding declaration

<p>The default encoding of Alore source files is UTF-8. It is possible to
specify the encoding of a source file using an encoding declaration:

@grammar
  encoding-decl :: "encoding" ("utf8" | "ascii" | "latin1") br
@end

<p>The identifier utf8 refers to the UTF-8 encoding (since it is the default,
the declaration has no effect), latin1 refers to the ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1)
encoding, and ascii refers to the ASCII encoding. If a utf8-bom token is
included at the
start of a file, only an encoding declaration with value utf8 can be present
in the source file, but as always when using the UTF-8 encoding, no encoding
declaration is required.

<p>In a source file that contains an encoding declaration, non-ASCII
characters (other than the UTF-8 BOM) must not be present in the source file
before the encoding identifier (utf8, ascii or latin1) of the encoding
declaration.

<p>The encoding declaration only affects comments and string
literals &#8212; any other tokens may only contain ASCII characters.
String literals will always be decoded to an internal 16-bit Unicode
representation. UTF-8 string literals will thus be automatically decoded during
compilation.
