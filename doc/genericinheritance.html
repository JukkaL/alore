@title Generic inheritance and generic interfaces

<ul>
  <li>Generic types may inherit other generic types
  <li>Give a few examples: one that maps X&lt;T&gt; to T and one in which
    the subtype is not generic but supertype is
  <li>A generic subtype may not define additional type variables not present
    in the supertype (unless the supertype is std::Object)
  <li>Subtyping and compatibility
  <li>Implicit and explicit dynamic inheritance
</ul>
