<p>Expressions perform all interesting computation in Alore programs.
Parentheses can be
used for grouping and for overriding operation evaluation order.

@h2 Operator precedence

<p>All Alore operators are listed below, from the highest to the
lowest precedence, with each operator on the same line having the same
precedence:

<ol>
  <li><tt>. () []</tt> (member access, function call, indexing)
  <li><tt>()</tt> (cast)
  <li><tt>**</tt>
  <li><tt>-</tt> (unary)
  <li><tt>* / div mod</tt>
  <li><tt>+ -</tt> (binary)
  <li><tt>to</tt>
  <li><tt>== != &lt; &lt;= &gt;= &gt; in is</tt>
  <li><tt>:</tt>
  <li><tt>not</tt>
  <li><tt>and</tt>
  <li><tt>or</tt>
  <li><tt>,</tt> (array constructor)
</ol>

<p>All operators except the exponentiation operator <tt>**</tt> are left
associative, i.e. <tt>a + b + c == (a + b) + c</tt>, whereas <tt>**</tt> is
right associative, i.e. <tt>a**b**c == a**(b**c)</tt>.

<p>The comma operator is used to form lists of arbitrary length. Associativity 
rules do not apply to the comma operator.

@h2 Lvalues and rvalues

<p>Expressions can be evaluated as either rvalues or lvalues. Lvalues are only
expected on the left hand side of an assignment statement. Valid lvalues
include:

<ol>
  <li>global variable references
  <li>member variable references
  <li>local variable references
  <li>member references
  <li>subscript expressions
  <li>superclass member references (but only when referring to a setter)
  <li>array constructors (all the array items must be valid lvalue expressions
    but not array constructors themselves)
  <li>uninitialized member constant references (but only in the <tt>create</tt>
    method of the class that contains the constant definition)
</ol>

<p>All expressions are valid in an rvalue context, by contrast. Note that
the left hand side of assignment may include rvalue expressions as the
subexpressions of lvalue expressions (target of member reference and
subscripts in subscript expressions).

<p>The semantics of lvalue expressions are described in section 
@href{Assignment statement}. The descriptions below only apply to rvalue 
expressions, unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.

@h2 Expressions in boolean context

<p>Some expressions are evaluated in a boolean context. Such
an expression is expected to evaluate to a boolean value, either 
<tt>True</tt> or <tt>False</tt>, as its value. If the expression 
evaluates to some other value, a @ref{std::TypeError} exception will be
raised.

@h2 Order of evaluation

<p>Operations within a single expression are always evaluated in their natural
order as specified by precedence and associativity rules: operations with a
higher precedence are evaluated first, and consecutive operations with the
same precedence are evaluated left to right (if the operations are left
associative) or right to left (otherwise). 
The natural evaluation order of comma-separated lists is from left to right.
Parentheses can be used to change the default operation evaluation order.

<p>Variable and constant references 
within a single expression may be evaluated in an arbitrary order, but all the 
operands and arguments of operations must be evaluated before the 
operation is performed.

<p>Otherwise, expressions and statements are always evaluated in their
entirety in the order described in this document, unless some operation causes
an exception to be raised. At the instant an exception is raised, any 
statements or expressions that are not fully evaluated are terminated.

@h2 Simple expressions

@grammar
  simple-expression :: int | float | str | "nil" | id | "self"
@end

<p>Integer literals evaluate to @ref{Int} objects. Correspondingly, float 
and string literals evaluate to @ref{Float} and @ref{Str} objects. The 
<tt>nil</tt> expression evaluates to the special <tt>nil</tt> object.
The <tt>self</tt> expression evaluates to the <tt>self</tt> 
object, i.e. the object that is bound to the current evaluated method or the
object whose getter or setter is being evaluated. All of these expressions are
only valid as rvalues.

<p><i>Id</i> evaluates to either a local variable, a member of <tt>self</tt>, 
or a global definition. Local definitions take precedence over other 
definitions and member definitions take precedence over global definitions 
(see @href{Precedence of names} for details). Evaluating a local or global 
reference results in the value of the variable or constant. Evaluating a
member 
reference is equivalent to evaluating the member reference <tt>self.id</tt>.
It results in the evaluation of the getter for <i>id</i> or in the creation of
a bound method object (see @href{Member references} for the details).

@h2 Referencing global definitions

@grammar
  gvar :: id ("::" id)+ | "::" id
@end

<p>A global reference evaluates to the value of a global definition. The form
<tt>::id</tt> refers to a 
global definition in the current module. Otherwise, the last <i>id</i> is the 
name of a global definition, and all elements before the last <tt>::</tt> form
the module prefix.

<p>If the module prefix matches the name of a module imported in the current 
source file,
the reference refers to that module. Otherwise, the prefix must form a
unique suffix of the name of any module that was imported in the current file.
In this case, the reference refers to that module. Otherwise, the reference
is invalid and a compile error will be reported.

@h2 Binary operations

@grammar
  binary-operation :: expression binary-op expression
  binary-op :: "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "div" | "mod" | "**" | "==" | "!="
    | "&#60;" | "&#60;=" | "&#62;" | "&#62;=" | "is" | "in" | "to" | ":"
@end

<p>Many of the binary operations are evaluated as method calls.
The table below contains the mappings between these operators and
methods. The operation
will be performed by calling the method mentioned in the table on the left
operand with the right operand as the
argument (but see (3) in the note section for an exception).
The return value of the chosen method is usually the result of the
operation (but see (2) in the note section). If the method is not
supported by the operand, a @ref{std::MemberError} exception will be raised.

</table>

<p>In addition, the following binary operators are not mapped to method calls,
but are evaluated directly:

<dl>
  <dt><b>is</b>
  <dd>Test whether the left operand is a member of a type specified by the
    right operand. Evaluate to a boolean value. Raise @ref{std::TypeError} if 
    the right operand is not a type. The nil value is not considered to be
    a member of any type.
  <dt><b>to</b>
  <dd>Construct a @ref{Range} object. The left operand is assigned to the
    <tt>start</tt> member and the right operand to the <tt>stop</tt> member.
    If one of the operands is not an integer, a @ref{std::TypeError}
    exception will be raised.
  <dt><b>:</b>
  <dd>Construct a @ref{Pair} object. The left and right operands are assigned
    to the <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt> members, respectively.
  <dt><b>and</b>, <b>or</b>
  <dd>Perform short-circuit boolean operations (see below).
</dl>

<p>Equality comparison against a literal <tt>nil</tt> value is treated
specially. In binary operations with == or != as the operator and a literal
<tt>nil</tt> expression as the right operand, the left and right operands are
swapped before evaluation.

@h2 Boolean operations

@grammar
  boolean-operation :: expression ("and" | "or") expression
@end

<p>The "<tt>and</tt>" and "<tt>or</tt>" operators are short-circuit boolean 
operators. Their
arguments are evaluated in a boolean context. The <tt>and</tt> operator 
evaluates to <tt>True</tt> if and only if both of the operands are 
<tt>True</tt>; otherwise, it evaluates to
<tt>False</tt>. The <tt>or</tt> operator evaluates to <tt>True</tt> if either 
one or both of the operands is <tt>True</tt>; otherwise, it evaluates to 
<tt>False</tt>.

<p>The boolean operators use <i>short-circuit evaluation</i>.
If the first operand of an <tt>and</tt> operation evaluates to 
<tt>False</tt> or if the first operand of an <tt>or</tt> operation
evaluates to 
<tt>True</tt>, the second operand is not evaluated at all. In this case, the 
value of the operation is the same as if the second operand evaluated to any 
boolean value, i.e. equivalent to the value of the first operand.

@h2 Unary operations

@grammar
  unary-operation :: ("-" | "not") expression
@end

<p>Both of the unary operations have unique semantics:

<ul>
  <li>The unary negation operator '<tt>-</tt>' is evaluated by calling the 
    <tt>_neg</tt> method of the operand with no arguments. 
  <li>The operand of the unary <tt>not</tt> operator is evaluated in a boolean
    context. The operation evaluates to the boolean negation of the operand.
</ul>
    
@h2 Subscripting

@grammar
  subscript-expression :: expression "[" expression "]"
@end

<p>The subscript expression is evaluated by calling the <tt>_get</tt> 
method of the left operand with the right operand (index) as the only argument.
The return value of that method is the value of the expression.

<p>The subscript expression is also valid in an lvalue context; see 
section @href{Assignment statement} for details.

@h2 Call expressions

@grammar
  call-expression :: expression "(" args ")"
  args :: [ "*" expression ] 
    | single-expression ("," single-expression)* [ "," "*" expression ]
@end

<p>The call expressions are used for executing the bodies of
functions and methods.
Additionally the evaluation of most operator expressions falls back to call
expressions.

<p>The expression before the left parenthesis evaluates to the
<i>called object</i>. The expressions, if any, between the parentheses evaluate
to the <i>actual arguments</i>. If the final argument expression is prefixed
with <tt>*</tt>, this argument is a <i>variable-length argument list</i>. 
Arguments not prefixed with <tt>*</tt> are the fixed (actual) arguments.

<p>If the called object is a global function, an anonymous function or a bound
method, the formal argument list and the body of the function are defined
by this object.
Otherwise, the formal argument list and the body of the function are those of
the <tt>_call</tt> method of the object being called. If this method is not 
defined, the object is not <i>callable</i> and an
exception will be raised.

<p>If the call expression has only fixed arguments and if all the formal
arguments are fixed and required (without default values), the function call
is evaluated as follows:

<ol>
  <li>Evaluate the called object expression.
  <li>Evaluate the actual argument expressions, from left to right.
  <li>If the called object is not callable, raise a @ref{std::TypeError} 
    exception.
  <li>If the number of actual arguments is not compatible with the number of
    formal arguments, raise a @ref{std::ValueError} exception.
    If there are fewer actual arguments than required formal arguments or more
    actual arguments than fixed formal arguments, the arguments are
    incompatible.
    As an exception, if the callee accepts a variable-length argument list,
    there is no upper bound for the number of arguments.
  <li>Create a new <i>invocation</i> of the called object that can hold copies
    of all the local variables and other state needed by the function call.
  <li>Assign the values of the argument expressions to local variables defined
    by the formal arguments and store them in the invocation. The actual
    arguments are in the same order as the formal arguments.
  <li>Evaluate the body of the function. All local variables in the body refer
    to this invocation of the function. There may be multiple invocations of
    any function or method active at a time, and they each keep their own
    separate state.
  <li>If the function exits by a return statement with a return value, this
    value is the value of the call expressions.
  <li>If the function exits by a return statement without a return value or
    without a return statement after all the statements in the body have been
    successfully evaluated, the call expression evaluates to <tt>nil</tt>.
  <li>If the function exits because of an uncaught exception, this exception
    is propagated to the calling function and the expression evaluation will
    be terminated. The exception will be handled within the calling function
    as if it was raised within it.
  <li>The invocation related to a function call will be destroyed after the
    function has exited. Individual local variables held by the
    invocation will outlive the invocation, however, if they may be referred
    after the invocation exit by an anonymous function object that was created
    within the invocation.
</ol>

<h3>Caller with a variable-length argument list</h3>

<p>If the call expression contains a variable-length argument list expression,
it must evaluate to an @ref{Array} or a @ref{Tuple} object (or an object of
an <tt>Array</tt> subclass). The items of this sequence
behave identically to fixed actual arguments, as if they were included at the 
end of the argument list as fixed arguments.

<h3>Arguments with default values</h3>

<p>If some of the formal arguments are optional (i.e. have default argument
values), these rules are followed:

<ol>
  <li>If there are more actual arguments than required formal arguments, these
    actual arguments are assigned to optional formal arguments.
    These formal arguments behave like required arguments in this invocation,
    and their default value expressions are ignored.
  <li>If there are not enough actual arguments to cover all the optional
    formal arguments, the rest of the optional arguments are 
    initialized to the values of the
    initialization expressions. The initialization expressions are evaluated
    sequentially from left to right. All the available actual arguments are
    assigned to the corresponding formal arguments before evaluating the
    initialization expressions.
</ol>

<h3>Callee with a variable-length argument list</h3>

<p>If the formals include a variable-length argument list, any number of
additional actual arguments are accepted beyond the fixed formal arguments.
An <tt>Array</tt> object is created that holds these extra arguments, in the 
same order they appear in the argument list. This object is assigned to the 
formal argument preceded by <tt>*</tt>. If there are no extra arguments, an 
empty <tt>Array</tt> object will be created and assigned instead.

@h2 Array constructors

@grammar
  array-expression :: "[" comma-list "]"
  comma-list :: single-expression | list-expression
  list-expression :: single-expression ("," | ("," single-expression)+ [ "," ])
@end

<p>Construct an @ref{Array} instance with the values of the subexpressions,
separated by commas, as the items. The length of the array is equal to the 
number of items in the array expression.

@h2 Tuple constructors

@grammar
  tuple-expression :: "(" ")" | list-expression
@end

<p>Construct a @ref{Tuple} instance with the values of the subexpressions,
separated by commas, as the items. The length of the tuple is equal to the 
number of items in the array expression.

<p>An empty tuple is constructed using the <tt>()</tt> form.
To construct a single-item tuple, a trailing comma must be provided.
Tuple expressions have to parenthesized when used in contexts where comma has
another meaning, such as in argument lists of call expressions.

@h2 Member references

@grammar
  member-reference :: expression "." id
@end

<p>This expression refers to the member <i>id</i> of an object, specified by
the left operand expression. In an rvalue context,
it is evaluated by either constructing a bound method object of type
<tt>std::Function</tt> (if the member refers to a method) or by evaluating the 
getter method of the member (if the member refers to a member variable or 
constant). Otherwise, if the member is not defined, raise a
@ref{std::MemberError} exception.

<p>In an lvalue context, <i>id</i> must refer to a member variable (a member
with a setter  method), or otherwise a @ref{std::MemberError} exception will be
raised. See section @href{Assignment statement} for details.

<p>It is an error to access the member <tt>create</tt> using a member reference
unless the left operand is <tt>self</tt>.

<h3>Bound methods</h3>

<p>If the member in a dot expression refers to a method, the result of
the operation is a @ref{std::Function} object that represents the method
<i>bound</i> to the specific object.
A bound method accepts the arguments specified in the method definition, and 
when the bound method is called, the body of the method is evaluated so that 
<tt>self</tt> refers to the bound object.

<h3>Evaluating getter and setter references</h3>

<p>Getters and setters behave like methods that take either no arguments
(getters) or a single argument (setters). Unlike methods, they can only be
directly called; it is not possible to build bound getter or setter method
objects. Is is also impossible to call getters or setters using the ordinary
() operator; they are only called implicitly when reading a member or
assigning to a member.

@h2 Superclass member references

@grammar
  super-reference :: "super" "." id
@end

<p>If the member <i>id</i> refers to a method in the current class, this is
evaluated to a bound method object
representing the definition of the method <i>id</i> in the superclass of the
current class. The method must be defined in the superclass. Bound method
references
are only valid in an rvalue context.

<p>If the member <i>id</i> refers to a member variable or constant in the
current class, the getter method of the member defined in the superclass of the
current class is called (in an rvalue context) or, in a similar fashion, the
superclass setter method is called
(in an lvalue context), giving the assigned value as the argument. The
getter or setter must be defined in the superclass.

<p>The super construct can only access public members defined in the
superclass. All public members inherited by the superclass can be accessed,
as well as any members defined or overridden in the superclass.

@h2 Anonymous functions

@grammar
  anonymous-function :: "def" "(" arg-list ")" br block "end"
@end

<p>This expression constructs a @ref{Function} object. The argument list and
  the body of the function are identical to ordinary function definitions
  (see section @href{Function definitions}). Anonymous functions may refer
  to local variables defined in the enclosing function or functions.
  An anonymous
  function object may outlive the invocation of the enclosing function(s).
  In that case the local variables defined in the enclosing function(s) that
  are referenced in an anonymous function will outlive the function invocation.

@h2 Cast expressions

@grammar
  cast-expression :: "(" cast-type ")" expression
  cast-type :: gvar | "dynamic"
@end

<p>The cast expression has two variants with different semantics:

<ol>
  <li>If <i>cast-type</i> is <tt>dynamic<tt>, the cast expression evaluates
    to the value of the operand expression.
  <li>Otherwise, the cast type <i>gvar</i> must refer to a type (class or
    interface) definition.
    To evaluate the cast expression, the operand expression is first evaluated.
    If the result is an instance of the cast type, this is also the
    result of the cast expression. Otherwise, raise @ref{std::CastError}.
</ol>
