@title Tuple operations

<p>These operations are provided for working with tuple objects. Only the most
commonly needed operations are supported. Generic operations such as
@ref{AIterator} and @ref{AIn} can be used as well to perform additional
operations.

<h2>Creating</h2>

@fun AValue AMakeTuple(AThread *t, Assize_t len)
@desc Create a <tt>std::Tuple</tt> object of the specified length. The object
      is initialized to contain <tt>nil</tt> values for all items.
      Use @ref{AInitTupleItem} immediately to initilize the tuple.
      @note You must
         not use partially initialized tuple objects for any other purpose than
         for initializing them. In particular, you must not return them from
         functions, assign them to non-local variables or pass them as
         arguments to functions or operations.
      @end
@end

<h2>Reading and updating</h2>

@fun Assize_t ATupleLen(AValue v)
@desc Return the length of a tuple. The argument must be a <tt>std::Tuple</tt>
      object. This function performs no error checking.
@end

@fun AValue ATupleItem(AValue v, Assize_t index)
@desc Return the value of an item in a tuple. The first argument must be a
      <tt>std::Tuple</tt> object, and the index (0-based) must be non-negative
      and less than the length of the tuple. This function performs no
      error checking.
@end

@fun void AInitTupleItem(AThread *t, AValue v, Assize_t index, AValue item)
@desc Initialize the value of an item in a tuple. The second argument must
      be <i>a newly allocated
      <tt>std::Tuple</tt> object that is not visible to any Alore code</i>,
      and the index (0-based) must be non-negative
      and less than then length of the tuple. This function performs
      no error checking of the argument values. Raise a direct exception if
      out of memory.
@end

<h2>Checking</h2>

@fun ABool AIsTuple(AValue v)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether the type of v is <tt>std::Tuple</tt>.
@end
