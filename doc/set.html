@title <tt>set</tt>: Set type

<p>The <tt>Set</tt> class implements a set of objects. Any objects that can
be used as @ref{Map} keys can be added to a set. The <tt>Set</tt> class
enforces the <i>set constraint</i>: any object may be included in a set at most
a single time. An object can be added to a set even when the set already
contains that object, but the operation will have no effect. The order of item
additions and removals is not significant &#8212; a set object only records
which objects are currently included in the set, but the objects have no
specific order.

@h2 Class <tt>Set&lt;T&gt;</tt>

@class Set()
@desc Construct an empty set. 
@end

@class Set(iterable as Iterable<T>)
@desc Construct and initialize a set. Iterate over the contents of the
      argument, which must be an iterable object, and add them to the set.
      Example:
      @example
        Set([1, 3, "x"])     -- Set with items 1, 3 and "x"
      @end
@end

<h3><tt>Set</tt> methods</h3>

@fun length() as Int
@desc Return the number of objects in the set.
@end

@fun add(object as T)
@desc Add an object to the set. If the object is already in the set, this
    operation does nothing.
@end
    
@fun remove(object as T)
@desc Remove an object from the set. Do nothing if the object is not included
      in the set.
@end

@fun iterator() as Iterator<T>
@desc Return an iterator object that iterates over all the objects in the set
  in an arbitrary order.
@end

@fun copy() as Set<T>
@desc Return a copy of the set with the same items as the original set.
  @note Only item references are copied to the new set
    &#8212; the items itself are not duplicated.
  @end
@end

<h3><tt>Set</tt> operations</h3>

<p><tt>Set</tt> objects support the following operations:

@op x in set @optype{Object in Set<T> -> Boolean}
@desc Test whether a set contains a specific object.
@end

@op for x in set @optype{for T in Set<T>}
@desc Set contents can be iterated with a for loop. The objects are
      iterated in an arbitrary order.
@end

@op set1 == set2 @optype{Set<T> == Object}
@desc Compare sets for equality. Two sets are equal if they contain the same
  objects.
@end

@op Str(set)
@desc Return a string representation of a set.
@end

@op Hash(set)
@desc Return the hash value of a set.
@end
