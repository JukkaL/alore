@class-hidden Tuple

<p>Instances of the <tt>Tuple</tt> class are fixed-length, immutable sequences
of values.

<p><tt>Tuple</tt> instances are constructed using the comma operator. By
convention, tuple expressions are often placed within parentheses:

@example
  (1, 2, "x")    -- 3-tuple with items 1, 2 and "x"
  1, 2, "x"      -- Equivalent to above, but without parentheses
@end

<p>There is special syntax for constructing an empty tuple and a single-item
tuple:

@example
  ()             -- An empty tuple
  (True,)        -- A single-item tuple
@end

<h2><tt>Tuple</tt> methods</h2>

@fun length() as Int
@desc Return the length of the tuple.
@end

@fun iterator() as Iterator<Object>
@desc Return an iterator object that can be used to sequentially iterate over
  the tuple items, starting from the first item.
@end

<h2><tt>Tuple</tt> operations</h2>

<p><tt>Tuple</tt> objects support the following operations:

@op tuple[n]
@desc Access tuple items with the indexing
      operator. The index <tt>n</tt> must an integer, and it can be negative.
      Raise the @ref{IndexError} exception if the index is not within bounds.

      @example
        var a = ("a", 1, True)
        a[0]        -- "a"
        a[-1]       -- True
      @end
@end

@op tuple == x, tuple &lt; x
@desc Tuples can be compared for equality and for lexicographic order. All the
  basic comparison operators are supported: ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;
  and &gt;=. Tuples can be compared with arrays, and an array and a tuple
  with the same items are equivalent.
@end

@op x, y, z = tuple
@desc Tuple objects can be expanded in a multi-assignment or a variable
      definition. The number of items
      in the lvalue must equal the length of the tuple.
      @example
        var a = (1, 3, "x")
        var x, y, z = a    -- x gets 1, y gets 3, z gets "x"
      @end
@end

@op for x in tuple
@desc Tuple items can be enumerated with a for loop, starting from the first
      item.
@end

@op x in tuple
@desc Test whether a tuple contains a specific object. Return a boolean value.
      The test is not recursive, i.e., tuples within tuples are not searched.
@end

@op Str(tuple)
@desc Return a string representation of the tuple contents.
@end

@op Hash(tuple)
@desc Return the hash value of a tuple.
@end
