@title Float operations

<p>Most of these operations deal with Float objects. A few additional utility
functions are provided as well. Of course, all standard C functions dealing
with floating point numbers such as sin and sqrt can be used as well, provided
that the required headers are included.

<p>Efficiency note: For maximal efficiency, try to avoid conversion and
creation operations, and perform as many operations as possible directly using
the C double type.

@see Sections @href{Arithmetic operations} and @href{Comparison operations}
  describe generic operations that can also be used with Float objects.

@h2 Creating

@fun AValue AMakeFloat(AThread *t, double f)
@desc Create a std::Float object. @raise-direct
@end

@h2 Reading

@fun double AGetFloat(AThread *t, AValue v)
@desc If v is a Float or Int object, return its value as a double. Otherwise,
  raise a direct @ref{std::TypeError} exception.
@end

@h2 Checking

@fun ABool AIsFloat(AValue v)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether v is a std::Float object.
@end

@fun void AExpectFloat(AThread *t, AValue v)
@desc Check if v is a Float object and raise a direct @ref{std::TypeError}
      exception if it is not.
@end

@fun ABool AIsInf(double f)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether f represents the positive or negative
      infinity.
@end

@fun ABool AIsNaN(double f)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether f represents not-a-number.
@end
