@title <tt>re</tt>: Regular expressions

<p>This module provides operations for matching and manipulating strings
using regular expressions. Regular
expressions may be represented as strings or instances of the @ref{RegExp}
class.

<p>Examples:

@example
  if Match("foo|bar", "bar   ") != nil -- Succeeds
    WriteLn("Match!")
  end

  var r = RegExp("a*b", IgnoreCase)
  var m = Search(r, "... AaaB ...")
  m.group(0)                           -- "AaaB"
@end

@note Use the @ref{RegExp} class for case insensitive matching.
@end

<h2>Functions</h2>

@fun Match(regexp as Str, str as Str[, pos as Int]) as MatchResult
@fun Match(regexp as RegExp, str as Str[, pos as Int]) as MatchResult
@desc Test if a regular expression matches at the start of the string.
      If the regular
      expression matches a (potentially empty) prefix of the string, return a
      <a href="#result">match object</a>
      describing the match. Otherwise, return <tt>nil</tt>. If the <tt>pos</tt>
      argument
      is provided, start the matching at the specified string index instead.
@end

@fun Search(regexp as Str, str as Str[, start as Int]) as MatchResult
@fun Search(regexp as RegExp, str as Str[, start as Int]) as MatchResult
@desc Search a string for a match of a regular expression. Return a
      <a href="#result">match object</a>
      describing the leftmost match or <tt>nil</tt> if no match could
      be found. If the <tt>start</tt> parameter is provided, start the
      matching at the specified string index instead of the string start.
@end

@fun Subst(str as Str, regexp as Str, new) as Str
@fun Subst(str as Str, regexp as RegExp, new) as Str
@desc Substitute all non-overlapping occurrences of a regular expression in a
      string with replacement values described by the
      <tt>new</tt> parameter.

      <p>If <tt>new</tt> is a string, it acts as a template for the replacement
      string.
      \0 in the <tt>new</tt> string is replaced with the string
      matched
      by the regular expression and \<i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a positive
      integer, is replaced with the string matched by the group <i>n</i> of the
      regular expression. A backslash not followed by a digit is
      replaced with the character following the backslash. Finally, the rest
      of the string is included literally in the replacement string.
      Example:

      @example
        Subst("foo fox", "fo+", "&lt;\0&gt;")   -- Result: "&lt;foo&gt; &lt;fo&gt;x"
      @end

      <p><tt>New</tt> can also be a callable object
      (of type <tt>def (MatchResult) as Str</tt>). In this case, call the
      object with the
      corresponding <a href="#result">match object</a> as the argument for
      each occurrence of the regular expression in the string. The object
      should return the replacement string when called. Example:

      @example
        Subst("cat sits on a table", "cat|table", def (m)
                                                    return m.group(0).upper()
                                                  end)
          -- Result: "CAT sits on a TABLE"
      @end
@end

@fun Split(str as Str, regexp as Str) as Array<Str>
@fun Split(str as Str, regexp as RegExp) as Array<Str>
@desc Split the string into fields at each non-overlapping occurrence of the
      regular expression. Return an array containing the fields. Example:
      @example
        Split("cat;  dog;horse", "; *")   -- Result: ["cat", "dog", "horse"]
      @end
@end

@fun FindAll(regexp as Str, str as Str) as Array<MatchResult>
@fun FindAll(regexp as RegExp, str as Str) as Array<MatchResult>
@desc Find all non-overlapping matches of a regular expression in a string.
      Return an array of @ref{MatchResult} objects that represent the matches.
      Scan the string from start to end. Include also empty matches, unless
      they coincide with the start of another match.
@end

<h2>Class <tt>RegExp</tt></h2>

@class RegExp(regexp as Str, ... as Constant)
@desc Construct a regular expression object. The first parameter
  must be a regular expression string. Optionally, the <tt>IgnoreCase</tt>
  constant can be given as an additional parameter to enable case insensitive
  matching. <tt>RegExp</tt> instances can be used instead of <tt>Str</tt>
  objects whenever regular expressions are expected.
  <p>Constructing a <tt>RegExp</tt> instance or passing a <tt>Str</tt> object
  as a regular expression may be costly, since the regular expression must be
  compiled into an internal form before matching.
  Using a single <tt>RegExp</tt> instance for multiple operations is often
  faster, since this allows reusing the compiled form.
@end

@end-class

<h2>Constants</h2>

@var IgnoreCase as Constant
@desc Flag for case insensitive matching, passed to @ref{RegExp}.
@end

<h2 id="result"><tt>MatchResult</tt> objects</h2>

<p>Match result objects are instances of the <tt>MatchResult</tt> class.
<tt>MatchResult</tt> should not be used to construct match result objects
directly. Match result objects have these methods:

@class-hidden MatchResult

@fun group(n as Int) as Str
@desc Return the substring matched by a specific group. The group 0 is the 
      substring matched by the entire regular expression. Return <tt>nil</tt>
      if the group exists, but it is within a part of the regular expression
      that was not matched.
@end

@fun start(n as Int) as Int
@desc Return the start index of the substring matched by a specific group.
      The group 0 refers to the
      substring matched by the entire regular expressions. Return
      -1 if the group exists in the regular expression, but it is
      within a part of the regular expression that was not matched.
      If a group matched an empty string, the start index is equal to the
      stop index.
@end

@fun stop(n as Int) as Int
@desc Return the stop index of the substring matched by a specific group.
      The group 0 refers to the
      substring matched by the entire regular expressions. Return
      -1 if the group exists in the regular expression, but it is
      within a part of the regular expression that was not matched.
      If a group matched an empty string, the span start index is equal to the
      stop index.
@end

@fun span(n as Int) as Pair<Int, Int>
@desc @deprecated
      Return a @ref{Pair} object representing the (non-negative) start and
      end indices of
      the substring matched by a specific group. The group 0 refers to the
      substring matched by the entire regular expressions. Return
      <tt>nil</tt> if the group exists in the regular expression, but it is
      within a part of the regular expression that was not matched.
      If a group matched an empty string, the span start index is equal to the
      stop index.
@end

@end-class

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

@class RegExpError
@desc Raised when one of the operations in this module is passed an invalid
  regular expression string. Inherits from @ref{std::ValueError}.
@end

<h2>Regular expression syntax overview</h2>

<p>Any character that does not have any other significance is a regular
expression that matches itself, i.e. "x" matches the letter "x" and so on.
Additionally, regular expressions can be constructed by following the rules
below (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> may refer to any regular expression):

<table class="no-border" summary="">
  <tr>
    <td><tt>.</tt></td>
    <td>Match any single character.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>^</tt></td>
    <td>Anchor match at the beginning of a string.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>$</tt></td>
    <td>Anchor match at the end of a string.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>ab</tt>
    <td>Match <i>a</i> followed by <i>b</i>.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>a*</tt>
    <td>Match <i>a</i> repeated 0+ times.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>a+</tt>
    <td>Match <i>a</i> repeated 1+ times.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>a?</tt>
    <td>Optionally match <i>a</i>.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>a|b</tt>
    <td>Match <i>a</i> or <i>b</i>.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>a{n}</tt>
    <td>Match <i>a</i> exactly <i>n</i> times.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>a{n,}</tt>
    <td>Match <i>a</i> at least <i>n</i> times.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>a{n,m}</tt>
    <td>Match <i>a</i> at least <i>n</i> and at most <i>m</i> times.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(a)</tt>
    <td>Match <i>a</i>. Use parentheses to group expressions. Each regular
        expression within parentheses is a <i>group</i>. Groups within a
        regular expression are numbered so that the leftmost parenthesized
        expression (the one where the index of the "(" character is smallest)
        is the group 1, the next is the group 2, etc.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[...]</tt>
    <td>Match any character inside the brackets. If the brackets contain
      character ranges of the form <tt>x-y</tt>, each such range matches any
      character in the range from x to y.
      Backslash sequences have the same behavior as described below, unless
      otherwise noted.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[^...]</tt>
    <td>Match the inverse of the corresponding [...] expression.
</table>

<p>Finally, combining backslash ("\") and another character or characters forms
special regular expressions. If the backslash sequence is not special, a
backslash followed by any character matches the following character. These are
the special backslash sequences:

<table class="no-border" summary="">
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\<i>n</i></tt>
    <td>Match the string matched by a parenthesized group (back reference) or
        an octal character code if <i>n</i> is an integer.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\x<i>nn</i></tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Match hexadecimal character code. <i>nn</i> must be an integer in
        hexadecimal.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\&lt;</tt>
    <td>Match the empty string at the beginning of a word.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\&gt;</tt>
    <td>Match the empty string at the end of a word.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\a</tt>
    <td>Match ASCII bell.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\b</tt>
    <td>Match ASCII backspace.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\d</tt>
    <td>Match any decimal digit [0-9].
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\D</tt>
    <td>Match any character except decimal digit [^0-9].
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\f</tt>
    <td>Match ASCII form feed.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\n</tt>
    <td>Match ASCII linefeed.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\r</tt>
    <td>Match ASCII carriage return.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\s</tt>
    <td>Match any whitespace character.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\S</tt>
    <td>Match any non-whitespace character.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\t</tt>
    <td>Match ASCII horizontal tab.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\v</tt>
    <td>Match ASCII vertical tab.
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\w</tt>
    <td>Match any alphanumeric character or the underscore ("_").
  <tr>
    <td><tt>\W</tt>
    <td>Match any non-alphanumeric and non-underscore character.
</table>
