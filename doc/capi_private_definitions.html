@title Private definitions

<p>
@indexitem A_PRIVATE
Global definitions (function, class, variable and constant definitions)
are public by default, i.e. they are visible when the module is imported.
These definitions may be marked private by replacing the definition name with
a A_PRIVATE macro like this:

@example
  A_VAR(A_PRIVATE("MyPrivateVariable"))
@end

<p>The only exception is the Main function, which is always
private, even if the A_PRIVATE macro is not used.

<p>Member variables can also be made private using the A_PRIVATE macro,
but methods and accessors must be
public. More or less the same result as using a private method can
be achieved by defining C-level functions that are not included in the module
definition, and by calling them directly in the C code.

@example
  /* This function is internal to the module and thus the calling convention
     may be arbitrary. The frame parameter can be used to access self. */
  static AValue MyPrivateMethod(AThread *t, AValue *frame, AValue arg)
  {
      /* do something */
      return ...;
  }

  static AValue MyPublicMethod(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      frame[...]  = MyPrivateMethod(t, frame, ...);
      return ...;
  }
@end

<p>Alternatively, you can define private global functions instead of private
methods.
