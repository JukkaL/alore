@index Stream

@implements Iterable<Str>
@supertypes

<p>The <tt>Stream</tt> class represents a generic stream of character data.
<tt>Stream</tt> provides a high-level buffered interface for reading and
writing strings, but does not implement the actual writing or reading.
<tt>Stream</tt> subclasses must provide <tt>_write</tt> and/or <tt>_read</tt>
methods for actually processing data.

@class Stream(... as Constant)
@desc Construct a Stream object. The arguments may include some of the options
      @ref{Input} and @ref{Output} (<tt>Input</tt> is the default if none
      are specified), and one of the buffering options @ref{Buffered},
      @ref{LineBuffered} or @ref{Unbuffered} (buffering is enabled by
      default). Finally, the arguments may include @ref{Narrow}
      to indicate a narrow (8-bit) stream that only accepts character codes
      less than 256. By default, any 16-bit character codes are supported.
@end

<h2><tt>Stream</tt> methods</h2>

@fun write(...)
@desc Write the arguments to the stream. Non-string arguments will be first
      converted to strings using the @ref{std::Str} constructor.
@end

@fun writeLn(...)
@desc Write the arguments to the stream, followed by a line break. Non-string
      arguments will be first converted to strings using the @ref{std::Str}
      constructor.
@end

@fun read() as Str
@desc Read the rest of the stream contents, until reaching the end of the
      stream. Close the stream and return the contents that were read.
      Return an empty string at the end of stream.
@end

@fun read(size as Int) as Str
@desc Read up to the specified number of characters from the stream and return
      them as a string. Read less than <i>size</i> characters only if the end
      of stream was encountered.
@end

@fun readLn() as Str
@desc Read a line from the stream, and return the line without the line ending.
      Raise @ref{IoError} if called at the end of stream.
@end

@fun readLines() as Array<Str>
@desc Read the rest of the stream as lines, close the stream and return an
      array containing the
      lines. Line endings are not included in the lines. The stream will be
      closed even if there is an IO error.
@end

@fun flush()
@desc Flush the output buffer of the stream by writing its contents. If the
      buffer is empty or does not exist, do nothing. This method can only
      be used on streams that support writing.
@end

@fun eof() as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether there are any characters
      left in the stream before the end of stream. This method can only be used
      on streams that support reading.
@end

@fun close()
@desc Close the stream by flushing the output buffers. Subclasses of
      <tt>Stream</tt>
      should also release any operating system resources that might be
      allocated for the object. Any stream operations other than
      <tt>close</tt> made to a closed stream object will fail. Calling
      <tt>close</tt> on a closed stream does nothing.
@end

@fun peek() as Str
@desc Return the contents of the input buffer as a string. If the input buffer
      is empty or does not exist, return an empty string. This method can only
      be used on streams that support reading.
@end

@fun iterator() as Iterator<Str>
@desc Return an iterator that iterates over all the lines in the stream.
      Line endings are not included in the lines.
@end

<h2><tt>Stream</tt> operations</h2>

@op for line in stream
@desc The lines in a stream can be enumerated with a for loop. Line endings
      are not included in the lines.
@end

<h2><tt>Stream</tt> subclass methods</h2>

<p>At least one of these methods must be provided by subclasses of
<tt>Stream</tt> (<tt>_write</tt> for output streams and <tt>_read</tt> for
input streams). <tt>Stream</tt> does not implement these and therefore is an
abstract class.

@fun _write(...)
@desc Write the arguments directly to the stream without buffering. The
      arguments are strings.
@end

@fun _read(size as Int) as Str
@desc Read up to the specified number of characters from the stream, directly
      without buffering. Return <tt>nil</tt> if at the end of the stream.
@end

@end-class
