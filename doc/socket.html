@title <tt>socket</tt>: Network connections

<p>This module supports creating TCP clients that create stream-based network
connections to other computers or processes. In this context, the term
<i>socket</i> refers to IPv4 stream sockets only.

@see Use the @ref{serversocket} module to create TCP servers.
@end

<h2>Class <tt>Socket</tt></h2>

@class Socket(destination, port[, buffering])
@desc Construct a TCP/IP connection stream to the specified port of the 
      destination
      host. The destination may be either a host name such as
      "www.host.com" or a numeric IP address such as "100.50.200.5" 
      (in decimal).
      <p>The buffering parameter specifies the buffering mode. If omitted,
      the connection is unbuffered. Valid values for the parameter are
      @ref{io::Buffered}, @ref{io::LineBuffered} and @ref{io::Unbuffered}.
      <p><tt>Socket</tt> is derived from @ref{io::Stream}. Like @ref{File}
      objects, <tt>Socket</tt> objects are <i>narrow streams</i>.
      <tt>Socket</tt> objects support both writing (sending) and reading
      (receiving) data.
@end

<p><tt>Socket</tt> instances are also implicitly created by the 
@ref{serversocket::ServerSocket} class.

<h3><tt>Socket</tt> methods</h3>

<p><tt>Socket</tt> inherits most of the @ref{Stream} operations unchanged,
including:

<ul>
  <li><b>write</b>
  <li><b>writeLn</b>
  <li><b>read</b>
  <li><b>readLn</b>
  <li><b>readLines</b>
  <li><b>flush</b>
  <li><b>eof</b>
</ul>

<p>It also supports the following operations:

@fun close()
@desc Close the connection. Free any resources allocated to the connection.
@end

@fun localAddress()
@desc Return the local IP address as a string
      in dotted decimal format (e.g. "100.50.200.5").
@end

@fun localPort()
@desc Return the local port number.
@end

@fun remoteAddress()
@desc Return the remote IP address as a string in dotted decimal
     format (e.g. "100.50.200.5").
@end

@fun remotePort()
@desc Return the remote port number.
@end

@end-class

<h2>Functions</h2>

@fun GetHostByName(name)
@desc Return the IP address of a host. The name argument may be a host name or
      a numeric IP address in dotted decimal format. If the host has
      multiple interfaces, only the address of the first interface is returned.
@end

@fun GetHostByAddress(address)
@desc Return the primary host name of the machine with the given IP address.
      The IP address must be a string in dotted decimal format.
@end

@fun GetHostName()
@desc Return a string containing the hostname of the machine where the program
      is running.
@end

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

@class NameError([message])
@desc This exception is raised for DNS name lookup related errors. In
      particular, @ref{GetHostByName} and @ref{GetHostByAddress} may raise
      this exception. Inherits from @ref{std::Exception}.
@end
