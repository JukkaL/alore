@title <tt>thread</tt>: Concurrent programming with threads

<p>This module provides low-level facilities for using concurrent
<i>threads</i> that are executed
conceptually simultaneously. The <tt>Mutex</tt> and <tt>Condition</tt> classes 
can be used to synchronize threads and implement communication between threads.

<p>Program execution starts in a
special <i>main</i> thread. The execution of a program ends after the main
thread ends. If any other threads are executing at program exit, they will be
forcibly terminated. It is recommended that programs explicitly end threads
by calling <tt>join</tt> to avoid data loss due to terminated threads.

<h2>Class <tt>Thread&lt;T&gt;</tt></h2>

@class Thread(function as def () as T)
@desc Construct a new thread. The thread calls the
      function with no arguments. The 
      function may be any callable object, and it is the
      <i>thread function</i> of the new thread.
@end

<h3><tt>Thread</tt> methods</h3>

@fun join() as T
@desc Wait until the execution of the thread stops. Return the value returned
      by the thread function. If the function raised an exception that was not
      caught, this method will raise that exception. Join can be called only 
      once for each thread object.
@end

<h2>Class <tt>Mutex</tt></h2>

@class Mutex()
@desc Construct a mutex.
@end

<h3><tt>Mutex</tt> methods</h3>

@fun lock()
@desc Lock the mutex. A mutex may be locked only once before calling
      <tt>unlock()</tt>.
      If the mutex is already locked by another thread while calling
      <tt>lock()</tt>,
      the calling thread waits until the mutex is unlocked and tries to lock
      the mutex again until it succeeds.
@end

@fun unlock()
@desc Unlock the mutex. The mutex must be locked. Only the same thread that
      has locked the mutex may unlock the mutex.
@end

<h2>Class <tt>Condition</tt></h2>

@class Condition()
@desc Construct a condition variable.
@end

<h3><tt>Condition</tt> methods</h3>

@fun wait(mutex as Mutex)
@desc Wait until another thread signals or broadcasts the condition variable. 
      The mutex
      must have been locked by the current thread before calling this method. 
      This method
      unlocks the mutex during the wait but locks it again before returning.
@end

@fun signal()
@desc Signal one of the threads waiting for the condition variable. If no 
      thread is
      waiting for the condition variable, this method does nothing.
@end

@fun broadcast()
@desc Signal all of the threads currently waiting for the condition variable. 
      If no 
      thread is waiting for the condition variable, this method does nothing.
@end

@end-class

<h2>Locking policy</h2>

<p><tt>Mutex</tt> objects are used for <i>mutual exclusion</i>, i.e. to make 
sure that 
only a single thread is accessing
a resource such as an object, a variable or a file at the same time. Sometimes
<tt>Mutex</tt> objects need to be used even though there is no obvious need 
for mutual exclusion. Therefore the rules below must be followed very carefully
in any code that uses threads.

<p>Each time a thread accesses a variable or an object, if that variable or
object may have been modified by another thread since the creation of that 
thread, that access
must be protected my a mutex. Likewise, the operations that actually modify
the variable or the object must be protected by the same mutex.

<p>For example, consider two simultaneous threads that call functions 
<tt>F1</tt> and <tt>F2</tt>:

@example
var Shared = 1

def F1()
  Shared = 2 <span class="error">-- Error!</span>
end

def F2()
  if Shared == 2 <span class="error">-- Error!</span>
    DoSomething()
  end 
end 
@end

<p>The function <tt>F2</tt> accesses a variable that may have been modified by 
<tt>F1</tt> in
another thread. This in an error, and to remedy this, all the variable accesses
must be protected by a mutex.

@note As an exception, some classes may perform the required locking 
automatically. Unless this is explicitly mentioned, however, the caller
must take care of locking. Remember that @ref{Stream} objects and their 
descendants do not typically perform any locking!
