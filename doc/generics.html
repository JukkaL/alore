@title Defining generic types and functions

<p>We have showed how to use generic types, but not how to define them. This
section explains how to define generic types. We also discuss generic
functions.

@h2 Defining a generic type

<p>This is a simple generic stack type:

@example
  class Stack&lt;T&gt;
    private var array = [] as Array&lt;T&gt;

    def create() as void
    end

    def isEmpty() as Boolean
      return self.array == []
    end

    def push(o as T)
      self.array.append(o)
    end

    def pop() as T
      self.array.removeAt(-1)
    end
  end
@end

<p>You can use it like this:

@example
  def Main() as void
    var s = Stack() as &lt;Int&gt;
    s.push(2)
    s.push(5)
    Print(s.pop())      -- 5
    Print(s.isEmpty())  -- False
  end
@end

<p>Keep these things in mind when you define generic types:

<ul>
  <li>You can use type variables (T in the stack example) in type
    declarations within a generic type, and they behave almost like
    ordinary types.
  <li>Two type variable types are not compatible with each other. A type
    variable type is compatible with <tt>Object</tt>, however.
  <li>Values with type variable
    types only support operations available for the <tt>Object</tt> type,
    such as assignment and the == operator.
  <li>You cannot cast a value to a type variable type.
  <li>You can mix static and dynamic typing within the body of a generic type.
</ul>

@h2 Generic functions

<p>Alore also supports generic functions and methods. They have one or more
type variables associated with them. Here is a simple generic function:

@example
  def First&lt;T&gt;(a as Array&lt;T&gt;) as T
    return a[0]
  end

  var ia = [3, 5] as Array&lt;Int&gt;
  var sa = ['foo', 'bar'] as Array&lt;Str&gt;
  First(ia)   -- 3
  First(sa)   -- 'foo'
@end

<p>You can replace the type variable (T in above example) with any type
when calling the function. Usually the type checker can infer the value of
the type variable, but you can also give it explicitly:

@example
  First(ai) as &lt;Int&gt;
@end

<p>Note that the syntax is similar to constructing instances of generic types.
