@title <tt>encodings</tt>: Character encodings

<p>This module contains constants and types for dealing with text data
in different character encodings.
Its main use is converting strings between 16-bit Unicode and 8-bit (narrow)
representations. <!-- Narrow strings must be used when dealing with narrow
streams and other narrow data sources.-->
Conversions between 8-bit narrow strings and 16-bit Unicode strings
are often needed, since many standard library
functions expect strings to be encoded in 16-bit Unicode, whereas many stream
classes (including @ref{File} and @ref{Socket}) and some functions
only support 8-bit strings.

<p>In addition to 8-bit Unicode encodings, this module also defines several
locale-specific encodings that only support a subset of Unicode.

<p>Examples:

@example
  "\u00c3\u00a4".decode(Utf8)             -- Decode "&#228;" in UTF-8 to 16-bit Unicode
  
  "\u20ac".encode(Utf8)                   -- Encode the Euro sign using UTF-8
  
  "s&#228;&#228;".encode(Ascii, Unstrict)           -- "s??" (replace characters that cannot be represented
                                          -- in ASCII with question marks)
                                          
  TextStream("file.txt", Latin1)          -- Open encoded text file for reading
@end

@see Use methods @ref{Str.encode} and @ref{Str.decode} for encoding and
     decoding strings.
@end
@see The classes @ref{io::TextFile} and @ref{io::TextStream} provide a simple
     way of accessing encoded text streams.
@end

<h2>Constants</h2>

@var Strict as Constant
@desc Mode option for encoding objects that indicates strict encoding or
      decoding. Invalid input causes an @ref{EncodeError} or a
      @ref{DecodeError} exception to be raised. This is the default behavior.
@end

@var Unstrict as Constant
@desc Mode option for encoding objects that indicates unstrict encoding and
      decoding. Invalid characters are replaced with question marks
      (<tt>"?"</tt>, when encoding) or with replacement
      characters (<tt>"\ufffd"</tt>, when decoding).
@end

@var Bom as Str
@desc The byte order mark character (<tt>"\ufeff"</tt>). Some platforms
      (most notably, Windows) often insert this character to the beginning
      of text files when using a Unicode encoding such as UTF-8.
@end

<h2>Character encodings</h2>

<p>This module defines the following character encoding objects. They all
implement the interface @href{Encoding}.

@var Ascii as Encoding
@desc The 7-bit ASCII encoding.
@end

@var Utf8 as Encoding
@desc The UTF-8 Unicode encoding.
@end

@var Uft16 as Encoding
@var Utf16Le as Encoding
@var Utf16Be as Encoding
@desc The UTF-16 Unicode encoding. The different variants stand for native,
      little endian and big endian byte orders.
@end

@var Iso8859_1 as Encoding (Latin1)
@var Iso8859_2 as Encoding (Latin2)
@var Iso8859_3 as Encoding (Latin3)
@var Iso8859_4 as Encoding (Latin4)
@var Iso8859_5 as Encoding
@var Iso8859_6 as Encoding
@var Iso8859_7 as Encoding
@var Iso8859_8 as Encoding
@var Iso8859_9 as Encoding (Latin5)
@var Iso8859_10 as Encoding (Latin6)
@var Iso8859_11 as Encoding
@var Iso8859_13 as Encoding (Latin7)
@var Iso8859_14 as Encoding (Latin8)
@var Iso8859_15 as Encoding (Latin9)
@var Iso8859_16 as Encoding (Latin10)
@desc The ISO 8859 8-bit encodings, with alias constants in parentheses.
@end

@var Windows1250 as Encoding
@var Windows1251 as Encoding
@var Windows1252 as Encoding
@desc These Windows encodings are also known as Windows code pages.
@end

@var Cp437 as Encoding
@var Cp850 as Encoding
@desc Legacy encodings that match MS-DOS code pages. Note that encoded
      characters in the range 0 to 31 and character 127 are decoded as the
      corresponding ASCII characters instead of the legacy graphical
      characters.
@end

@var Koi8R as Encoding
@desc The KOI8-R encoding for Russian.
@end
  
@var Koi8U as Encoding
@desc The KOI8-U encoding for Ukrainian.
@end

@class-hidden Encoding
@h2 Interface <tt>Encoding</tt>

<p>Character encoding objects support creating <i>encoder</i> and
<i>decoder</i> objects using the methods <tt>encoder</tt> and <tt>decoder</tt>,
respectively. These methods can be called without
arguments or with an optional mode argument (@ref{Strict} or
@ref{Unstrict}). If mode is not specified, it defaults to
<tt>Strict</tt>. Each encoder / decoder instance keeps track of the state of a
single encoded / decoded text sequence.

<p>Programs typically do not use <tt>Encoder</tt> and <tt>Decoder</tt> objects
directly, but they use @ref{Str.encode} and @ref{Str.decode} methods and text
streams.

@fun encoder([mode as Constant]) as Encoder
@desc Construct an encoder object for the encoding.
@end

@fun decoder([mode as Constant]) as Decoder
@desc Construct a decoder object for the encoding.
@end

@var name as Str
@desc The name of the encoding. Example:
      @example
        Utf8.name   -- "Utf8"
      @end
@end

@class-hidden Encoder
@h2 Interface <tt>Encoder</tt>

@fun encode(str as Str) as Str
@desc Encode the argument string and return the encoded string. The entire
      string is always encoded.
@end

@class-hidden Decoder
@h2 Interface <tt>Decoder</tt>

@fun decode(str as Str) as Str
@desc Decode as many characters as possible from the argument string and
      return them. If any partial characters remain at the end of the string,
      remember them and prepend them to the next argument to decode. Use
      <tt>unprocessed</tt> to have a peek at them.
@end

@fun unprocessed() as Str
@desc Return the current buffer of partial characters, or an empty string if
      there are none.
@end

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

@class EncodeError
@desc Raised when encoding is not successful due to invalid input. Inherits
      from @ref{std::ValueError}.
@end

@class DecodeError
@desc Raised when decoding is not successful due to invalid input. Inherits
      from @ref{std::ValueError}.
@end

@end-class

<h2>Functions</h2>

@fun Decode(string as Str, encoding as Encoding[, mode as Constant]) as Str
@desc @deprecated
      Decode a string. The mode argument may be @ref{Strict}
      (this is the default if the argument is omitted) or @ref{Unstrict}.
      Example:
      @example
        Decode(s, Utf8)         -- Decode UTF-8 string to 16-bit Unicode
      @end
      @note Use the @ref{Str.decode} method instead.
      @end
@end

@fun Encode(string as Str, encoding as Encoding[, mode as Constant]) as Str
@desc @deprecated
      Encode a string. Identical to
      <tt>encoding.encoder([mode]).encode(s)</tt>.
      The mode argument may be @ref{Strict} (this is the default if
      the argument is omitted) or @ref{Unstrict}. Example:
      @example
        Encode("\u20ac", Utf8)  -- Encode the Euro sign in UTF-8
      @end
      @note Use the @ref{Str.encode} method instead.
      @end
@end

<h2>About supported character encodings</h2>

<p>This module supports only a small and somewhat arbitrary set of
locale-specific encodings, with a bias towards encodings for European
languages. New encodings are likely to be added to this module (or to separate,
additional modules) in future Alore releases.
