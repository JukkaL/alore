@h2 Tokens

<p>Each source file is divided into tokens, starting from the beginning of the
file.

<p>Identifiers (<i>id</i>) are case sensitive. Some of them are reserved; see
section @href{Reserved words} below.

@grammar
  id :: alpha alphanum+
  alpha :: "a".."z" | "A".."Z" | "_"
  alphanum :: alpha | digit
  digit :: "0".."9"
@end

<p>Numeric literals (<i>int</i> and <i>float</i>) are entered in base 10.
Floating point literals can optionally have a fractional part, separated with
a dot, and an integer exponent, separated with the letter <i>e</i>. If the
exponent is present, the numeric value 
before the exponent is multiplied by 10**<i>e</i>, where <i>e</i> is the 
numeric value of the exponent.

@grammar
  int :: digit+
  float :: digit+ exponent | digit* "." digit+ [ exponent ]
  exponent :: ("e" | "E") ["+" | "-"] digit+
@end

<p>String literals (<i>str</i>) are entered within single or double quotes.
The surrounding quotes are not part of the string value. Literal
double quotes in double-quoted strings and literal single quotes in
single-quoted strings must be duplicated.

@grammar
  str :: &lt;&quot;&gt; (&lt;any character except &quot;, CR or LF&gt; | &lt;&quot;&gt; &lt;&quot;&gt;)* &lt;&quot;&gt;
       | &lt;'&gt; (&lt;any character except ', CR or LF&gt; | &lt;'&gt; &lt;'&gt;)* &lt;'&gt;
@end

<p>A sequence of form <tt>\uHHHH</tt> within a string literal, where each
<tt>H</tt> is a hexadecimal digit (0..9, a..f or A..F), is mapped to the
character code represented by the hexadecimal number. Backslash characters
are not special within string literals unless immediately followed by
<tt>"u"</tt> and a 4-digit hexadecimal number.

<p>Various non-alphanumeric operator and punctuator tokens are defined:

@grammar
  opsym :: "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "**" | ":" | "==" | "!=" | "&#60;" | "&#62;" | "&#62;=" | "&#60;="
  punct :: "(" | ")" | "[" | "]" | "," | "=" | "+=" | "-=" | "*=" | "/=" | "**=" | "::"
@end

<p>Newlines and semicolons can be used as statement separators (<i>br</i>).
They are interchangeable. Repeated statement separators behave identically to
a single statement separator.

@grammar
  br :: (newline | ";")+
  newline :: &lt;CR&gt; &lt;LF&gt; | &lt;LF&gt; | &lt;CR&gt;
@end

<p>Whitespace and comments are ignored before and after tokens. Whitespace
characters are optional, except between a token ending with an alphanumeric
character and another token starting with an alphanumeric character, in which
case they are required. Finally, there must be no whitespace characters before
the <i>initial-comment</i> and <i>utf8-bom</i> tokens.

@grammar
  whitespace :: " " | &lt;TAB&gt;
  comment :: "--" &lt;any character except CR or LF&gt;*
@end

<p>An initial source line starting with #! is interpreted as a comment:

@grammar
  initial-comment :: "#!" &lt;any character except CR or LF&gt;*
@end

<p>The special <i>utf8-bom</i> token may be present at the start of UTF-8
encoded files:

@grammar  
  utf8-bom :: &lt;EF&gt; &lt;BB&gt; &lt;BF&gt;
@end

@h2 Joining lines

<p>Newlines after the following tokens are interpreted as whitespace, not
as statement separators:

@example
  + - * / ** div mod and or : to is == != &lt; &lt;= &gt;= ( [ = += -= *= /= **= ,
@end

<p>This can be used to divide long lines into multiple shorter lines.

<p>A <i>br</i> token after a <tt>&gt;</tt> token is ignored in expressions,
but not in other contexts. This rule allows a type
annotation to end with a <tt>'&gt;'</tt> token, even when followed by
a <i>br</i> token.

@h2 Reserved words

<p>The following words are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers 
(i.e. as names of global or local definitions, as member names or as module
name components):

@example
  and
  as
  bind
  break    
  case     
  class    
  const    
  def      
  div
  dynamic
  elif     
  else     
  encoding 
  end      
  except
  finally  
  for      
  if
  implements
  import   
  in
  interface
  is       
  mod      
  module   
  nil      
  not      
  or       
  private  
  raise   
  repeat  
  return  
  self    
  super   
  switch  
  to      
  try     
  until   
  var     
  while     
@end

@h2 Restricted names

<p>Module name components and names of global definitions starting with two
underscores (__) are reserved for internal use by the implementation. The
implementation may freely define such names for any purpose, but user programs
should not depend on their presence or absence to remain portable with
different Alore implementations.

<p>Additionally, it is recommended that the following names not be used as the
first component of a module name, since they are reserved for use in future
releases of Alore:

@example
  compiler
  crypt
  email
  ftp
  ftpserver
  httpserver
  locale
  postgres
  process
  queue
  serialize
  smtp
  sqlite
  ssl
  stack
  timezone
  udp
  unicode
  xml
  xmltree
@end

<p>It is likely that some of these names will never be used in any future Alore
release. Future Alore releases may remove some names from this list; these
changes are retroactively applied to all earlier Alore versions as well.

@h2 Encoding

<p>Alore source files may be encoded in ASCII, UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1).
See section @href{Encoding declaration} for information on specifying the
encoding of a source file.

<p>All 7-bit character codes except CR and LF (10 and 13, respectively) can be
used in comments and string literals, including null characters, independent of
the source file encoding. Quotes, however, may have to be doubled within
string literals.

<p>In an ISO-8859-1 encoded source file, all character codes in range from 128
to 255, inclusive, can be used in comments and string literals. Similarly in a
UTF-8 encoded source file, all valid UTF-8 sequences for code points between
128 and 65535, inclusive, can be used in comments and string literals.
Any character code between 0 and 65535 can be entered in a string literal
using the <tt>\uHHHH</tt> form, independent of the source file encoding.
