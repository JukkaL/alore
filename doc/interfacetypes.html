@title Interfaces

<ul>
  <li>Motivation for interfaces
  <li>Introduce interfaces with an example
  <li>Interfaces have no implementations; only signatures
  <li>Introduce generic interfaces by using interfaces in the standard
    libraries (Iterable, Sequence, Comparable)
  <li>For loop and Iterable
  <li>Refer to later sections for additional information (defining generic
    types, intersection types, generic interfaces)
</ul>
