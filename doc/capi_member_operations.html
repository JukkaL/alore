@title Member operations

<p>This section contains definitions of functions that can be used to read
or write members. Several different methods of accessing members are available,
the main differentiating factor being efficiency. Specifying the
member name as C strings is simple, but it is also the slowest method. Numeric
member ids are a faster way of accessing members, with some additional
complexity. Direct member access using a slot index is fastest, but its use is
severely limited to a specific set of circumstances.

@see Calling methods is described in section @href{Call operations}.

@h2 Accessing public members

@fun AValue AMember(AThread *t, AValue object, const char *member)
@desc Return the value of a public member of an object (or AError). This is
      equivalent to using the dot operator.
@end

@fun AValue ASetMember(AThread *t, AValue object, const char *member, AValue mv)
@desc Set the value of the specified public member of an object to value mv.
      This is
      equivalent to using the dot operator on the left-hand-side of an
      assignment statement. The return value is ANil, if successful, or
      AError.
@end

@fun AValue ASuperMember(AThread *t, AValue *frame, const char *member)
@desc Return the value of the specified public member based on the definition
      in the
      superclass. This is equivalent to using <tt>super.member</tt> in Alore
      code. This
      function should only be called while executing a method, and the frame
      argument must point to the frame of the method.
      <p>If member refers to a method, a bound method is returned that can be
      passed to @ref{ACallValue} to call the method. Here is an example:
      @example
        AValue ExampleMethod(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
        {
            /* Get a bound method object that is bound to the method myMethod
               defined in the superclass and the self object. */
            AValue s = ASuperMember(t, frame, "myMethod");
            if (AIsError(s))
                return AError;
            /* Call the method myMethod defined in the superclass. /*
            return ACallValue(t, s, 0, frame + 1);
        }
      @end
@end

@fun AValue ASetSuperMember(AThread *t, AValue *frame, const char *member, AValue mv)
@desc Set the value of the specified public member of an object to value mv,
      using the setter defined in the superclass. This is
      equivalent to performing an assignment using the super keyword:
      @example
        super.member = mv
      @end
      <p>The return value is ANil, if successful, or AError.
@end

<!--
@ fun ABool AHasMember(AValue object, const char *member)
@ desc Return a boolean indicating whether an object has the specified public
      member defined or inherited.
@ end
-->

@fun int AMemberNum(AThread *t, const char *member)
@desc Return a numeric id of a member. This id can be used instead of the name
      of the member to refer to the member in some contexts.
@end

@fun AValue AMemberByNum(AThread *t, AValue object, int member)
@desc Return the value of a public member of an object. This is equivalent
      to using the dot operator. The member is specified using a numeric id
      obtained using <tt>AMemberNum</tt>.
@end

@fun AValue ASetMemberByNum(AThread *t, AValue object, int member, AValue mv)
@desc Set the value of the specified public member of an object to value mv.
      This is
      equivalent to using the dot operator on left-hand-side of an assignment
      statement. The member is specified using a numeric id obtained using
      <tt>AMemberNum</tt>.
@end

@fun ABool AHasMemberByNum(AValue object, int member)
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether an object has the specified public
      member defined or inherited. The member is specified using a numeric id
      obtained using <tt>AMemberNum</tt>.
@end

@h2 Direct member access

@note Direct member access is possible only in some specific contexts. Direct
      member access is most commonly used for accessing private member
      variables, direct member access being the only supported way of
      accessing them. See the links below for details.
@end

@fun AValue AMemberDirect(AValue object, int num)
@desc Return the value of a member. The member is specified using a numeric
      <i>slot index</i> num. See
      @href{Accessing member variable slots directly}
      for more information. This operation never raises an exception and
      performs no error checking.
@end

@fun void ASetMemberDirect(AThread *t, AValue object, int num, AValue mv)
@desc Set the value of a member. The member is specified using a numeric
      <i>slot index</i> num. See
      @href{Accessing member variable slots directly}
      for more information. @raise-direct
@end
