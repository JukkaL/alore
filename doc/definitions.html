@title Definitions

<p>This section contains definitions of various terms used in this document.

<dl>

<dt><b>accessor method</b>
<dd>A getter or a setter.

<dt><b>compile error</b>
<dd>Any compile errors in a program must be reported when the program is
    compiled or the program execution is being started, and they prevent the
    execution of the program.

<dt><b>error</b>
<dd>In this document, the term <b>error</b> is a synonym for
  <b>compile error</b>.

<dt><b>explicit member variable</b>
<dt><b>explicit member constant</b>
<dd>These are member variables and constants defined with the <tt>var</tt> or
    <tt>const</tt> keywords. See also <b>implicit member variable</b>.

<dt><b>fully qualified name</b>
<dd>The fully qualified name of a global definition contains the complete name
    of the module that contains the definition, the <tt>::</tt> operator and
    the short name of the definition. For
    example, the fully qualified name <tt>foo::bar::X</tt> refers to the
    definition <tt>X</tt> in the module <tt>foo::bar</tt>. For definitions in
    the main module, the fully qualified name is equal to the short name.
</dd>

<dt><b>getter</b>
<dd>A getter is a special method that is called every time a member variable or
    constant is read to provide the requested value. When explicit member
    variables and constants are defined, <i>implicit</i> getters are
    automatically defined for them.

<dt><b>implementation</b>
<dd>Implementation refers to the software system that includes the Alore
  compiler, the Alore run-time system and the standard modules.

<dt><b>implicit member variable</b>
<dt><b>implicit member constant</b>
<dd>These are member variables and constants that only have getters or setters
    but no associated value slots.

<dt><b>invocation</b>
<dd>The term invocation refers to the state related to a single call
  operation: the value of called object, values of local variable bindings
  active during the call and the state of the evaluation of the function call
  (i.e. which statement or subexpression is currently being evaluated).
  Multiple
  invocations related to the same callable object may be active at a same
  time, and they are independent of each other with separate local variables
  and states of evaluation.

<dt><b>main module</b>
<dd>The unnamed module that is formed by the main source file of the program.

<dt><b>program</b>
<dd>A program contains a main source file and any modules imported by the
  main source file or other modules that are part of the program.

<dt><b>setter</b>
<dd>A setter is a special method that is called every time a member variable is
    assigned to. When explicit member
    variables are defined, <i>implicit</i> setters are automatically defined
    for them.

<dt><b>short name</b>
<dd>The short name of a definition is the name used in the definition without a
    module prefix.

<dt><b>value slot</b>
<dd>The value slots in objects contain the values of any explicit member
    variables and constants defined in the class of the object. They provide
    the primary way of building composite user-defined objects.
