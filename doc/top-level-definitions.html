@title Top-level definitions and statements

<p>Top-level definitions and statements form the actual functional content of
source files.

@grammar
  defs :: (def br)*
  def :: statement | [ "private" ] (var-def | function-def | class-def | interface-def)
@end

<p>Top-level definitions include variable (and constant), function and class
definitions. They may be marked <i>private</i> by prefixing them with the
<tt>private</tt> keyword. Private definitions are only visible in the module
that defines them. Definitions that are not private are <i>public</i>.
The top-level may also include statements.

<p>As an exception, a function named <tt>Main</tt> is always private even if
the definition is not prefixed with <tt>private</tt>.

@h2 Variable and constant definitions

@grammar
  var-def :: ("var" | "const") id-list [ "=" expression ]
  id-list :: id ("," id)*
@end

<p>The <tt>var</tt> keyword introduces global variables and the
<tt>const</tt> keyword introduces global constants. If the initialization
expression is omitted, the value of
global variables will default to <tt>nil</tt>, and global constants will be
assigned a @ref{Constant} object, whose name is the fully qualified name of
the constant.
For example, the uninitialized constant <tt>A</tt> in module <tt>y</tt> will
receive <tt>y::A</tt> as its name.

<p>If the initialization expression is provided, the value of this expression
is assigned to the variables / constants. The semantics are similar to the
assignment statement. Before this expression has been evaluated (see
@href{Initialization} for details), the value of the variables / constants
will be <tt>nil</tt>.

<p>Constants differ from variables in that they cannot be lvalues, i.e. targets
of an assignment (other than the initialization).

@h2 Function definitions

@grammar
  function-def :: function-header br block "end"
  function-header :: "def" id "(" arg-list ")"
  arg-list :: [ var-args ] | argument ("," argument)* [ "," var-args ]
  var-args :: "*" id
  argument :: id [ "=" single-expression ]
@end

<p>The <tt>def</tt> keyword introduces a function. The name of the function
is given after the <tt>def</tt>
keyword. The <i>formal</i> arguments for the function are within parentheses
after the name of the function, and the block after the argument list is the
<i>body</i> of the function.

<p>The definition constructs a @ref{std::Function} object that conforms to the
definition and
assigns it to a constant specified by the name of the function. This object
can be called to execute the body of the function (see section
@href{Call expressions} for
details).

<p>The formal arguments become local variables within the function body. Their
values depend on the <i>actual</i> arguments (values) that are provided when
the function is called using the () operator.

<p>If an argument has an assignment of an expression, this argument is
<i>optional</i> and the expression is used
to evaluate the value of the argument if no value is provided by the caller.
This expression may refer to global definitions and formal arguments defined
before that argument within the function definition.

<p>The formal arguments not prefixed by an asterisk  (<tt>*</tt>) are called
<i>fixed</i> arguments. Fixed arguments that are not optional are
<i>required</i> arguments. All
required arguments must precede any optional arguments in the argument list.

<p>An asterisk is used to define a variable-length argument list. It specifies
that the function accepts an unbounded
number of arguments. If the number of actual arguments is larger than the
number of fixed arguments, the rest of the argument values will be assigned
to a newly created @ref{Array} object, and the object will be assigned to
the last formal argument.

@h2 Class definitions

@grammar
  class-def :: "class" id [ "is" gvar ] [ implements ] br (cdef br)* "end"
  implements :: "implements" gvar ("," gvar)*
  cdef :: [ "private" ] (member-var-def | method-def | getter-def | setter-def)
@end

<p>Use the <tt>class</tt> keyword to define a class (or a type; the terms are
used more or less interchangeably). The name of
the class is given after the <tt>class</tt> keyword. If the name is followed
by
the <tt>is</tt> keyword and a reference to a class definition, the referenced
class is a <i>superclass</i> of the defined class. It is an error if the
global variable reference after <tt>is</tt> does not refer to a visible class
definition. If the superclass is not present, it defaults to @ref{std::Object}.

<p>The <i>class header</i> is followed by the <i>class body</i>.
The body may contain
member variable, member constant, method and accessor method (getter or
setter) definitions.

<p>An instance of the @ref{std::Type} class representing the defined class
is bound to a constant variable defined by the name of the class. This is
called the <i>type object</i> of the class.

<p>All definitions in the superclass are <i>inherited</i> by the class. If
there is no explicit superclass, the class will inherit definitions from
@ref{std::Object}.

<p>Private definitions are marked with the <tt>private</tt> keyword. These
definitions can only be accessed through the <tt>self</tt> object in the class
that contains the definitions. Other definitions are public and can be accessed
without restriction.

<h3>Object identity and state</h3>

<p>The state of an object consists of the identity of the object, the type of
the object (which cannot be modified after object construction) and the values
of any value slots, including value slots associated to inherited member
variables.
Each constructed object has an identity that is separate from any other object.
The type specifies the operations
(methods and member getters and setters) supported by the object.

<p>If the object does not overload the <tt>==</tt> operator (with the
<tt>_eq</tt> method), the <tt>==</tt> operator can be used to test if an
object
reference is equal to another (i.e. if they have the same identity). This
behavior is inherited from @ref{std::Object}.

<h3>Object creation</h3>

<p>The type object can be called to create instances of the defined class,
i.e. objects with the defined class as their type. The arguments to the type
object are the same as to the <tt>create</tt> method of the class. The
<tt>create</tt> method
can be either defined in the body of the class, inherited from the superclass
or created automatically (<i>implicit create</i>; see below).

<p>The call of a type object is evaluated in several steps:

<ol>
  <li>Construct an empty instance of the class, with all value slots
    initialized to <tt>nil</tt>.
  <li>Evaluate any initializer expressions of member variables and constants in
    the superclasses, starting from the top of the class hierarchy.
  <li>Evaluate any initializer expressions of member variables and constants in
    the current class.
  <li>Call the <tt>create</tt> method of the class. The original
    arguments given to the type object are given as the arguments of the
    method.
  <li>If the <tt>create</tt> method is evaluated successfully, return a
    reference to the constructed object as the return value of the original
    call. If the <tt>create</tt> method returns a value, it is ignored.
</ol>

<p>Initializer expressions in a class body are evaluated in the order the
definitions appear in the source file.

<h3>Implicit create</h3>

<p>The implicit <tt>create</tt> method is defined automatically for classes
that have no explicit or inherited <tt>create</tt> method. It takes a single
argument for
each uninitialized member variable or constant defined in the class body.
If the body contains no such members, it takes no arguments. The
method simply assigns the argument values to the uninitialized member variables
and constants. The order of the arguments is the same as the order of the
corresponding members in the source file, so that the first argument is
assigned to the first uninitialized member, and so on.

<h3>Method definitions</h3>

@grammar
  method-def :: function-def
@end

<p>Methods are defined using the same syntax as functions (see
@href{Function definitions} above). Their behavior is similar to ordinary
functions, but they can only be called in the context of an object of the
enclosing class (or one of its subclasses, unless the method is private).
This object can be accessed using the <tt>self</tt> keyword in the body of the
method.

<p>A method of an object is accessed using the dot
(<tt>.</tt>) operator. The result is a bound method object that can be called
to execute the method (see sections @href{Member references} and
@href{Call expressions} for details).

<h3>Member variable and constant definitions</h3>

@grammar
  member-var-def :: var-def
@end

<p>Member variables and constants can be defined <i>explicitly</i> with a
syntax identical to global variable definitions. Like global variables, they
may be given default values.

<p>The value of an explicit member variable or constant is stored in a
<i>value slot</i>. Every instance of a class has a separate value slot
associated with every explicitly defined member variable and constant. A value
slot can refer to any object. All value slots are initialized to <tt>nil</tt>
at the beginning of object creation, including those related to constants
without initializers.

<p>A getter method with the same name as the variable is automatically defined
for each explicit member variable or constant, and a setter is defined for each
explicit member variable.  The getter simply returns the value in the slot, and
the setter modifies the value in the slot (see section @href{Member references}
for details). The value of the slot is usually accessed
or modified only through getter and setter methods. As an exception, the value
of the initialization expression is assigned directly to the value slot,
without invoking the setter method. The <tt>create</tt> method can also
assign values to the value slots of member constants defined in the same class
that contains the <tt>create</tt> method.

<h3>Getter and setter definitions</h3>

@grammar
  getter-def :: "def" id br block "end"
  setter-def :: "def" id "=" id br block "end"
@end

<p>The <tt>def</tt> keyword is also used to define a getter method or
a setter method for a member. These are used to
implement reading and modifying a member variable or constant
(see @href{Member references} for details). An alternative way of defining
member variables and constants was described in the previous section. Note that
simply defining a getter or a setter does not allocate a value slot in the
instance; only explicit member variables and constants have value slots.

<p>A getter method should always return a value (if no exceptions are raised).
The return value of a setter method is ignored.

<p>The additional identifier after the = token in a setter definition names the
local variable that will hold the new value assigned to the member. This
variable acts like an ordinary method argument, but it may not have a default
value.

<p>The body of a getter or a setter is a block, and follows the same rules as
method bodies, unless mentioned otherwise above. In particular, the
<tt>self</tt> object can be accessed within the bodies of getters and setters.

<p>Getters and setters are also defined implicitly by every explicit member
variable or constant definition. Note that redefining the implicit getter and
setter methods of a member variable is possible only by overriding them in a
subclass.

<p>It is an error to define a setter for a member that has no getter.
However, defining a setter is always optional.

<h3>Overriding superclass definitions</h3>

<p>Subclasses may override public method, getter and setter definitions
located in any
superclasses by redefining them. A method in a superclass can be overridden
by defining a method with the same name in a subclass. In a similar fashion, a
getter or a setter method can be overridden by defining a getter or a setter,
respectively, with the same name in a subclass. The method signatures
(argument lists) of the
original and the overriding (new) definitions do not have to be similar.

<p>Definitions in subclasses usually take precedence over the definitions
in the superclasses: all ordinary member references, including those made with
the dot (<tt>.</tt>) operator, direct references using only member names, and
references made in inherited methods and accessors, refer to the new
definitions.

<p>The <tt>super</tt> keyword can be used to access the original, overridden
definitions of methods and accessors (see
@href{Superclass member references}).

@h2 Interface definitions

@grammar
  interface-def :: "interface" id [ "is" gvar ] br (bind-def br)* (idef br)* "end"
  bind-def :: "bind" gvar
  idef :: function-header | "def" id | "def" id "=" id
@end
