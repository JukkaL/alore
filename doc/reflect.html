@fun GetMember(instance, id as Str) as dynamic
@desc Return a member of an instance. The <tt>id</tt> argument must be a
    <tt>Str</tt> object. Raise <tt>MemberError</tt> if the member is
    not defined. Example:
    @example
      var range = 2 to 5
      GetMember(range, "start")  -- 2
    @end
@end

@fun SetMember(instance, id as Str, value)
@desc Set the value of a member of an instance. The <tt>id</tt> argument must
    be a <tt>Str</tt> object. Raise <tt>MemberError</tt> if the member
    is not defined or if it is a method or a constant.
@end

@fun HasMember(instance, id as Str) as Boolean
@desc Return a boolean indicating whether an instance has a specific member.
    The <tt>id</tt> argument must be a <tt>Str</tt> object.
@end

@fun TypeOf(instance) as Type
@desc Return the type object corresponding to the class of the argument.
      <tt>TypeOf</tt> works for all values except <tt>nil</tt>;
      if the argument is <tt>nil</tt>, raise a @ref{ValueError} exception.
      The returned object is a type object bound to the relevant class
      definition. Examples:

      @example
        TypeOf(1)        -- std::Int
        TypeOf([1, 2])   -- std::Array
      @end

      @see @ref{std::TypeName}
      @end
@end
