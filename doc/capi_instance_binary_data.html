@title Storing binary data in instances

<p>The most common way of storing data in class instances is by defining
member variables or constants that refer to the data. When dealing with
existing C frameworks, however, it is often desirable to store C level
data structures or pointers inside Alore objects. This section gives an
overview of including arbitrary C level binary data within Alore objects.

@see You can also use functions described in section @href{Memory management}
     for the same purpose.
@end

@h2 Using per instance binary data

<p>These macros can be used to allocate fixed size data blocks in each
instance of the class. These blocks can be used to store any C level data
such as pointers, structs or floating point numbers. Binary data is always
initialized to zero early during object construction, even before create or
@ref{#i} is called. See section
@href{Accessing binary data} below for information on accessing and modifying
the binary data.

@fun A_BINARY_DATA(size)
@desc Include a data block of the given size, in bytes, in each instance of
      the class.
@end

@fun A_BINARY_DATA_P(size, intPtr)
@desc Include a data block of the given size, in bytes, in each instance of
      the class. Store the offset of the data block in *intPtr (intPtr should
      have type int *). This offset
      can be used to access the data.
@end

@h2 Using external data

@fun A_EXTERNAL_DATA()
@desc If this definition is present in a class definition, you can use
      the function @ref{ASetExternalDataSize} to set the amount of external
      data not visible to the garbage collector that is attached to an object
      of the class. If this definition is included, you must also include the
      @ref{#f} method in the class. A_EXTERNAL_DATA() can only be used in
      classes that do not inherit another class (other than std::Object).
      This macro also creates
      a single member slot in the class.
@end

@h2 Defining initialization and finalization methods

<p>The following special method names can be used for controlling the
life cycle of objects:

<h3>
@indexitem #i
#i</h3>

<p>The method "#i", if defined, will be called during object construction,
before calling create, at least when both of these conditions are satisfied:

<ul>
  <li>An object of a subclass of the original class (that defined #i) is
   being constructed (note that it is not called when an object of the original
   class is being constructed).
  <li>The subclass (or one of its superclasses) has overridden the create
    method defined in the original class.
</ul>

<p>This method should be used to initialize any binary data attached
to the object. Note that both the #i method and the original create
method can be called during object construction: the create method defined
in the subclass may call the original create method using the <tt>super</tt>
keyword.

<h3>
@indexitem #f
#f</h3>

<p>The method "#f", if defined, is called just before an object is freed by
the garbage collector. This method, also called the <i>finalizer</i>, is
special in several ways, including these:

<ul>
  <li>The AThread *t argument is always NULL when this method is called.
    Any API functions that require an AThread *t argument cannot
    be used within a finalizer method.
  <li>The function frame only has the self value (frame[0]) defined. The
    function should not accept any arguments or allocate temporary values in
    the frame.
</ul>

<p>Note also that when #f is called, the object might already be partially
freed, and the heap might be in an inconsistent state. This means that:

<ul>
  <li>The method #f must not allocate garbage-collected memory.
  <li>The method #f must not access the contents of any object in the garbage
    collected heap, except for the binary data stored in self and
    blocks allocated using @ref{AAllocMemFixed} that are directly referenced
    by self.
</ul>

<p>In practice, the only thing that should be done in a #f method is to free
any external resources (e.g. operating system resources, memory allocated
using malloc) so that they will not be leaked when the object is freed.
The method should check if any data has been left uninitialized, since it is
possible that #f is called before the object has been fully constructed.

<p>As a side effect of defining #f, the member slot 0 is reserved by the
implementation for internal use. See
@href{Accessing member variable slots directly} for additional information.

@note You can only define #f in a class if the class inherits from
      std::Object
      or if one of the superclasses also defines #f.
@end

@h2 Accessing binary data

<p>The following API functions can be used to access binary data in instances.
They are described in the API function reference, linked below.

<ul>
  <li>@href{ADataPtr}
  <li>@href{ASetData_M}
  <li>@href{AGetData_M}
</ul>

<p>All of these functions require the offset of the data to be accessed.
This first A_BINARY_DATA definition in a class gets the offset 0, and
additional A_BINARY_DATA definitions get larger offsets. Binary data defined in
subclasses always gets larger offsets that data defined in superclasses.

<p>For example, consider class X that inherits from Y. Y defines a single
binary data block of 8 bytes and X defines two blocks sized 4 and 16 bytes.
The following table lists the offsets and sizes of these blocks in objects
of class X:

<table class="with-border" summary="">
  <tr>
    <th>Offset
    <th>Size
  <tr>
    <td>0
    <td>8
  <tr>
    <td>8 (0 + 8)
    <td>4
  <tr>
    <td>12 (0 + 8 + 4)
    <td>16
</table>

@h2 Alignment of binary data

<p>Binary data at offset 0 is aligned to a 32-bit boundary (if using a 32-bit
AValue type) or to a 64-bit boundary (if using a 64-bit AValue type). If
there is more than a single A_BINARY_DATA declaration in in a class hierarchy,
the offset of a binary data declaration other than the first declaration (which
always has offset 0)
is simply the sum of the data sizes in previous declarations. Alignment is thus
enforced only for the first binary data declaration in a class hierarchy.
Example of unaligned binary data:

@example
  A_MODULE(...)
      A_CLASS("Example")
          A_BINARY_DATA(1)    /* Offset 0 (32/64-bit aligned) */
          A_BINARY_DATA(2)    /* Offset 1 */
          A_BINARY_DATA(8)    /* Offset 3 */
          ...
      A_END_CLASS()
  A_END_MODULE()
@end

<p>Since some architectures do not allow accessing unaligned data items
directly, you either have to enforce the alignment manually by rounding the
sizes of data blocks up, for example, or by copying the data to/from another
properly aligned location using @ref{ADataPtr} and memcpy.

@indexitem A_VALUE_BITS
<p>You can use the macro A_VALUE_BITS to query the current size of the AValue
type. Its value is currently either 32 or 64.

@h2 Example

<p>This example defines a simple class that is a wrapper for data allocated
using malloc. Very little error checking is performed to highlight the key
issues. A more robust implementation would at least check that method
parameters are in a valid range to avoid memory corruption.

<!-- FIX int size below should probably be size_t size... -->

  #include &lt;alore/alore.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;string.h&gt;

  static AValue Create(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      int size;
      char *ptr;

      size = AGetInt(t, frame[1]);
      ptr = malloc(size);
      if (ptr == NULL)
          return ARaiseMemoryError(t);
      memset(ptr, 0, size);
      ASetData_M(frame[0], 0, char *, ptr);
      ASetExternalDataSize(t, frame[0], size);
      return frame[0];
  }

  static AValue Finalize(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      char *ptr = AGetData_M(frame[0], 0, char *);
      free(ptr); /* Note that ptr may be 0. */
      return ANil;
  }

  static AValue Set(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      int index = AGetInt(t, frame[1]);
      int value = AGetInt(t, frame[2]);
      char *ptr = AGetData_M(frame[0], 0, char *);
      ptr[index] = value;
      return ANil;
  }

  static AValue Get(AThread *t, AValue *frame)
  {
      int index = AGetInt(t, frame[1]);
      char *ptr = AGetData_M(frame[0], 0, char *);
      return AMakeInt(t, ptr[index]);
