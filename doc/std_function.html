@title Class <tt>std::Function</tt>
@index Function

<p>Instances of the <tt>Function</tt> type are functions (named or anonymous)
  or bound methods. <tt>Function</tt> instances cannot be constructed using the
  type constructor &#8212; new functions can be created using a global
  function definition or an anonymous function expression, and bound methods
  are created by reading a method member of an object.

@see See sections @href{Call expressions}, @href{Member references},
  @href{Anonymous functions} and @href{Function definitions} in the Alore
  Language Reference for additional information.

@class Function
@desc The <tt>Function</tt> type. <tt>Function</tt> objects can only be created
      with a function definition, an anonymous function expression or by
      accessing a bound method using the dot (<tt>.</tt>) operator.
@end

<h2>Operations</h2>

@op function(...)
@desc Calling is the primary operation supported by <tt>Function</tt> objects.
      The related
      function or method definition specifies the number of accepted arguments,
      the behavior of the function and the return value, if any. Each
      function call operation creates a new <i>invocation</i> of the function
      with local variables and arguments whose values are independent from
      every other invocation of the function.
@end

@op Str(function)
@desc Return a string containing the fully qualified name of the
      <tt>Function</tt> object.
