@title Class <tt>std::Object</tt>
@index Object

<p><tt>Object</tt> is the top class in the Alore class hierarchy, and all
other classes are either directly or indirectly derived from it.
<tt>Object</tt> defines an empty constructor, and the only operation that it
supports is identity-based equality comparison using == or !=.

<p>A class that does not define a superclass implicitly inherits from
<tt>Object</tt>:

@example
  class A
  end

  A() is Object  -- True
  A() == A()     -- False (== operation inherited from Object)
@end

@class Object()
@desc Construct an instance of <tt>Object</tt>.
@end

<h2>Operations</h2>

@op object == x
@desc An instance of <tt>Object</tt> is equal only to itself.
@end
