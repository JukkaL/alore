@title Class <tt>std::Float</tt>
@index Float

<p>Instances of the <tt>Float</tt> class are floating-point numbers (floats). A
float is an approximation of a real number, and can represent whole and
fractional numbers, both small and large in magnitude. Internally
<tt>Float</tt> objects are 64-bit IEEE double-precision floating-point numbers,
with up to 15 significant digits of accuracy.

@class Float(x)
@desc Construct an object of the <tt>Float</tt> type. Call the
    <tt>_float()</tt> method of the argument and return a value equal to the
    result, provided that it is a float. Of the primitive types, <tt>Str</tt> 
    and <tt>Int</tt> objects provide a <tt>_float</tt> method. String arguments 
    may contain optional blank and tab characters before and after the number.
    Otherwise, the syntax of the string arguments must follow the Alore float
    literal syntax.
@end

<h2>Operations</h2>

<p><tt>Float</tt> objects support the following operations (<tt>f</tt> below
refers to a <tt>Float</tt> value):

@op f + x
@op f * x
@desc Perform an addition or multiplication operation. If the right operand
      <tt>x</tt> is an integer or a float, the result is a float.
      If <tt>x</tt> is neither an integer or a float,
      return <tt>x + n</tt> (or <tt>x * n</tt> for a multiplication operation)
      instead.
@end

@op f - x
@op f / x
@desc Perform a subtraction or a division operation. The right operands
      <tt>x</tt> may be an integer or a float, and the result is a float.
@end

@op f div x
@desc Perform integer division. The result is <tt>f</tt> / <tt>x</tt> rounded down
      to the nearest integer represented as a float. The right operand
      <tt>x</tt> may be an integer or
      a float.
      @example
        7.1 div 3.0     -- 2.0
        -4.2 div 3.0    -- -2.0
      @end
@end

@op f mod x
@desc Perform the modulus operation. The result is chosen so that
      (<tt>f div x) * x + f mod x</tt> == <tt>f</tt>
      (the equality is only
      approximate due to the inexact nature of floating point numbers).
      The right operand <tt>x</tt>
      may be an integer or a float, and the result is a float.
@end

@op f ** x
@desc Perform the exponentiation (power) operation. The right operand may be
      an integer or a float, and the result is a float. The operator
      follows the following rules in special conditions:
      
      <ul class="sep">
        <li><tt>0.0 ** 0</tt> == 1.0
        <li><tt>0.0 ** 0.0</tt> == 1.0
        <li>If <tt>f</tt> &lt; 0 and <tt>x</tt> is not an integer, raise
          @ref{ArithmeticError}.
      </ul>
@end

@op -f
@desc Return the negation of a float.
@end  

@op f == x
@desc Floats can be compared for equality with arbitrary objects.
  A float object is equal to an equivalent float or integer value.
  If <tt>x</tt> is neither an integer nor a float,
  the operation is evaluated as <tt>x</tt> == <tt>f</tt> instead.
  @note The last property enables user-defined types to be compared with
        floats usefully.
  @end
@end

@op f &lt; x, f &gt; x
@desc Floats can be compared for order with floats and integers.
  If <tt>x</tt> is neither a float nor an integer,
  the operation is evaluated as <tt>x</tt> &gt; <tt>f</tt>
  (for a &lt; operation) or <tt>x</tt> &lt; <tt>f</tt> (for a &gt; operation).
  @note The last property allows user-defined types to be compared with
        floats usefully.
  @end
@end

@op Str(f)
@desc Convert a float to a string. The result contains up to approximately 10
  significant digits.
@end

@op Repr(f)
@desc Convert a float to a string. The result contains up to approximately 16
  significant digits.
@end

@op Int(f)
@desc Convert a float to an integer, truncating any fraction.
@end

@op Hash(f)
@desc Return the hash value of a float.
@end
