@title Coexisting with the garbage collector

<p>The Alore runtime includes a garbage collector that frees unused memory
automatically by periodically scanning the heap to find unreferenced memory
blocks. It can also perform <i>copying garbage collection</i> which involves
moving blocks to different memory locations behind the scenes.

<p>A garbage collection cycle may be triggered by any memory allocation
operation. Due to the presence of the garbage collector, some operations that
normally would never require memory allocation, for example setting an array
item or a member variable, may actually cause memory allocation. This is due
to the <i>write barrier</i> employed by the garbage collector that requires
most heap modification operations to be checked and potentially recorded.

<p>Modules implemented using the Alore C API must cooperate with the garbage
collector, or otherwise heap corruption may occur. In particular, the following
issues must be addressed:

<ul>
  <li>All object references must be visible to the garbage collector. Most
    notably, C local variables are not visible, and therefore their use must
    be controlled. Local values stored in the function frame may be used
    instead.
  <li>Memory blocks may be moved as a side effect of any memory allocation
    operation. Therefore keeping C pointers to
    blocks in the garbage collected heap is, in general, not possible.
</ul>

<p>Code using the Alore C API typically does not need to worry
about freeing memory
when it is no longer being used. However, it is possible to also use normal C
memory management functions such as malloc and free, but they do not use the
garbage collected heap and thus are not automatically freed by the garbage
collector. Although using C memory management functions is generally
discouraged, wrapping existing C code typically requires dealing with data
allocated in the C heap.

<p>The rest of this section deals with these issues in more detail.

@h2 Operations that trigger garbage collection

<p>We previously mentioned that any operations that may cause memory to be
allocated may trigger a garbage collection operations that, in turn, may
free any unreferenced objects and move others around the heap. Here we define
in detail which operations may and which may not allocate memory.

<p>These conditions may trigger a garbage collection cycle:

<ul>
  <li>Calling any Alore C API function that takes AThread * argument, unless
    the description of the function mentions otherwise.
  <li>Code implemented in Alore may cause garbage collection at any time.
  <li>Garbage collection may also be initiated asynchronously at any time after
    calling @ref{AAllowBlocking} and before calling @ref{AEndBlocking} in the
    same thread.
</ul>

<p>Garbage collection may <b>not</b> be performed at any other point in program
execution, for example at these points:

<ol>
  <li>Ordinary C code statements such as assignment expressions, if statements
    and return statements when they do not involve calls to Alore C API
    functions.
  <li>Calls to ordinary C functions such as strlen or malloc.
  <li>Calls to Alore C API functions that do not take an AThread *
    argument, such as AIsInt.
  <li>Certain calls to Alore C API functions whose description mentions that
    no memory is allocated if certain conditions hold.
  <li>When evaluating the arguments to an Alore C API function, if the arguments
    themselves do not involve any operations that may trigger garbage
    collection.
  <li>Assigning the value returned by a Alore C API function.
</ol>

@h2 Keeping values visible to the garbage collector

<p>The main rule to follow in order to properly cooperate with the garbage
collector is this: All references to Alore objects must be visible to the
garbage collector during any operation that may trigger garbage collection.

<p>These values are visible to the garbage collector:

<ul>
  <li>values stored in the function frame, for example function arguments
  <li>values stored in other Alore objects (e.g. array items and member
    variables) if the other Alore object is visible
  <li>values stored in Alore-level global values, e.g. Alore constants or
    global variables (defined in Alore code or using macros such as A_VAR)
  <li>values stored in temporary locations allocated using AAllocTemp or
    AAllocTemps (these functions are described later in section
    @href{Low-level operations}).
</ul>

<p>Since the Alore garbage collector is <i>precise</i>, it cannot see
references stored in arbitrary locations in the C stack, C global variables or
C heap. So these references are not visible to the garbage collector, for
example:

<ul>
  <li>C global variables
  <li>C local variables
  <li>C function arguments
  <li>C struct members
  <li>temporary values generated during C expression evaluation
  <li>references in blocks allocated using malloc/realloc
  <li>AValue items stored as binary data, e.g. in blocks allocated using
    AAllocMem
</ul>

<p>Is it often necessary to have <i>hidden references</i>, i.e. references
that are not visible to the garbage collector, but this should be temporary and
you must remember that <i>all</i> hidden references become invalid after any
operation that may cause a garbage collection.

<p>Consider this code, for example:

@example
  frame[3] = AMakePair(t, frame[4], frame[5]);
@end

<p>The values of expressions frame[4] and frame[5] are hidden, since they are
temporarily values, but this is valid since they are not used after the call to
AMakePair, which makes them invalid. Also, the return value may be stored in
a temporary location before
assigning to frame[3], but in this case, no garbage collection may be triggered
since the call to AMakePair has already finished.

<p>The code below is invalid, however, since the order of evaluation of
function arguments in unspecified in C, and thus the value of expression
frame[4] may be made invalid by the call to AMakeInt:

@example
  frame[3] = AMakePair(t, AMakeInt(t, 1), frame[4]);  <span class="error">-- Error!</span>
@end

<p>Here is another invalid example. The value of expression frame[1] or
frame[0] may become invalid by one of the ALen calls:

@example
  frame[2] = ALen(t, frame[0]) + ALen(t, frame[1]);  <span class="error">-- Error!</span>
@end

<p>If you are unsure about the expression evaluation order rules of C, it
may be safest to only perform at most a single C API function call in a single
C expression, making the order of operations explicit.

@h2 Dealing with malloc and similar functions

<p>Often C modules will access data structures or resources that must be
manually allocated using C functions. A typical example is memory blocks
allocated using malloc that must be freed with free. The Alore garbage
collector cannot automatically free these kinds of resources, but there are
facilities available for instructing it how to clean up C resources.

<p>If a resource is needed only briefly during a single function call, it
might be easiest to simply free the resource before leaving the function.
This might be complicated by the presence of exceptions, as detailed in
section @href{Direct exceptions and freeing resources}.

<p>If a resource needs to remain allocated across several function calls, it is
often easiest to define a class that wraps the resource and manages the freeing
of the resource. This was detailed in section
@href{Storing binary data in instances}.

<p>Finally, you could define a C-level global variable that contains a
reference to the data structure. Separate functions for allocating, accessing
and freeing the resource can be provided. This might be the easiest approach to
implement, but users will have to manually free the allocated resources.

@h2 Performing long-running operations

<p>Garbage collection in Alore happens synchronously in the presence
of threads: each thread must notify the thread executing the garbage collection
cycle that they are ready for garbage collection. This is ordinarily performed
transparently by the Alore runtime.

<p>However, long-running operations that do not call any API functions that
allocate memory may prevent other threads from performing garbage collection,
causing them to stall. In these cases, the functions @ref{AAllowBlocking} and
@ref{AEndBlocking} must be called to enable garbage collection.

<p>In particular, if you call a C function not part of Alore C API that
may take more than, say, 10 milliseconds to execute, you should surround the
call with calls to the previously mentioned functions. If you perform
calculations that do not involve a single long-running function call but
that perform lengthy calculations in a loop without allocating any memory,
for example, you should call @ref{AAllowBlocking} immediately followed by
a call to @ref{AEndBlocking} at least once every 10 milliseconds or so. A
simple example:

@example
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
      /* do something */
      if (i % 1000000 == 0) {
          /* Call these functions periodically. */
          AAllowBlocking();
          AEndBlocking();
      }      
  }
@end
