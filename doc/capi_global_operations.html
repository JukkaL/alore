@title Accessing global variables and definitions

<p>These functions can be used to access or modify the values of global 
definitions. Global definitions include global functions, classes, variables 
and constants. Some of these functions refer to the definition using
the fully qualified name of the definitions, such as <tt>io::File</tt>, and
some refer using a numeric id. Numeric ids can be obtained using the
@ref{AGlobalByNum} function as described below, or by using a _P variant macro
when defining the global definition, described in  section 
@href{Variant macros}.

@fun AValue AGlobal(AThread *t, const char *name)
@desc Return the value of a global definition. The name must be the fully
      qualified name of the definition. All available definitions, including
      private ones, can be 
      accessed using this function without having to respect the ordinary Alore
      visibility rules. The only requirement
      is that the module containing the definition has been imported at least 
      once and it has not been freed by the garbage collector. @raise-direct
      Example:      
      @example
        AValue intType = AGlobal(t, "std::Int");
      @end
@end

@fun int AGetGlobalNum(AThread *t, const char *name)
@desc Get the internal numeric id of a global definition. The valid argument
      values are the same as for the <tt>AGlobal</tt> function above. The 
      numeric id can be used as an argument for the functions described
      below and some additional functions such as @ref{ARaiseByNum}.
      @raise-direct
@end

@fun AValue AGlobalByNum(int num)
@desc Return the value of a global definition using a numeric id to refer to
      the definition.
@end

@fun void ASetGlobalByNum(int num, AValue v)
@desc Set the value of a global variable using a numeric id to refer to the
      variable. The num argument must refer to a global variable. No error
      checking is performed: num must refer to a global variable, not
      a constant or another type of definition.
@end

@fun void ASetConstGlobalByNum(AThread *t, int num, AValue v)
@desc Set the value of an empty global constant using a numeric id to refer to
      the constant. The num argument must refer to an empty global constant
      defined using @ref{A_EMPTY_CONST} or @ref{A_EMPTY_CONST_P}.
      @note You must use ASetConstGlobalByNum only in the Main function of
        a module, and only for initializing empty global constants defined in
        that module.
      @end
@end

<!-- FIX: Add ASetGlobal... -->
