@implements Comparable<Date>
@implements Addable<Int, Date>
@supertypes

<p>The <tt>Date</tt> class represents a date or a day. <tt>Date</tt> instances
are immutable.

@class Date()
@desc Construct a <tt>Date</tt> object representing the current date (today)
      in local time.
@end

@class Date(year as Int, month as Int, day as Int)
@desc Construct a <tt>Date</tt> object representing a specific day. All
      arguments must
      be integers. Month and day values are not restricted to any specific
      range. If they are outside the valid range of values, they are
      normalized and the excess is moved to the month or year values. So if
      month is 14, the actual month value becomes 2 and year is incremented by
      one; if day is 0, the resulting day will be the last day of the previous
      month, etc.
      @example
        Date(2010, 3, 8)           -- 8th of March, 2010
      @end
@end

@class Date(string as Str[, format as Str])
@desc Construct a <tt>Date</tt> object from a string. The format argument
      specifies the format of the string.
      If the format is omitted, the default format is "YYYY-MM-DD".
      <p>The format must contain <i>format sequences</i> for all
      date components (day, month, year). A format sequence matches a date
      component in the string. The following list contains all the
      available format sequences and examples of valid values:

      <table class="no-border" summary="Format sequences">
        <tr>
          <td>D
          <td>day of month (1, 2, ...,  31)
        <tr>
          <td>DD
          <td>day of month, at least 2 digits (01, 02, ... 31)
        <tr>
          <td>M
          <td>month (1, 2, ..., 12)
        <tr>
          <td>MM
          <td>month, at least 2 digits (01, 02, ... 12)
        <tr>
          <td>MMM
          <td>abbreviated name of month (Jan, Feb, ..., Dec)
        <tr>
          <td>MMMM&nbsp;
          <td>name of month (January, February, ..., December)
        <tr>
          <td>YY
          <td>year, 2 digits (00, 01, ... 99)
        <tr>
          <td>YYYY
          <td>year, 4 digits (1978, 2010, ...)
      </table>

      <p>Case is not significant in the month names and abbreviations.
      The YY values 69-99 are mapped to years 1969-1999, and 00-68 are mapped
      to years 2000-2068. You should generally use the YYYY format for
      years so that years before 1969 and after 2068 can be represented.

      <p>Any other characters in the format must be matched by the same
      character in the string. As an exception, a backslash \ followed by a
      character <i>c</i> must be matched by <i>c</i>.
@end

<h2>Members</h2>

@var day as Int
@desc Day of month (the first day of the month is 1)
@end

@var month as Int
@desc Month number (1 = January, 2 = February, ...).
@end

@var year as Int
@desc Year number (e.g. 2010)
@end

@var weekday as Int
@desc Weekday of the date (1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, ..., 7 = Sunday).
@end

@fun week([rule as Constant]) as Int
@desc Return the week number. The rule argument specifies how the week number
      is calculated. It can be one of
      @ref{FirstWeek}, @ref{FirstFourDayWeek} or
      @ref{FirstFullWeek}. If unspecified,
      <tt>FirstFourDayWeek</tt> is assumed. Sunday is considered to be the
      last day of the week and Monday the first.
@end

@fun format(template as Str) as Str
@desc <p class="trim">Format the date as a string.
      The template string defines the format of
      the result. The following <i>formatting sequences</i> in the template
      are replaced with formatted <tt>Date</tt> components (examples within
      parentheses):

      </table>
      <p>Other characters in the template are copied as such to the result.
        As an exception, a backslash \ followed by a character <i>c</i> is
        replaced with <i>c</i>.

<h2>Operations</h2>

@op date + n @optype{Date + Int -> Date}
@desc Integers representing a number of days can added to and subtracted from
      dates. <tt>Date() + 1</tt>, for example, refers to tomorrow.
@end

@op Str(date) @optype{Str(Date) -> Str}
@desc Convert a date to a string of the form "YYYY-MM-DD".
@end

@op date1 == date2 @optype{Date == Date -> Boolean}
@op date1 &lt; date2 @optype{Date &lt; Date -> Boolean}
@op date1 &gt; date2 @optype{Date &gt; Date -> Boolean}

      than a later date.
