@title <tt>std</tt>: Basic services

<p>This module defines several basic types, constants and utility functions.
The types include the primitive types, basic collection types and several
exception types.
The <tt>std</tt> module
is the only module that is always imported without an explicit <tt>import</tt>
definition,
and its services are used by practically every Alore program.

<h2>Functions</h2>

@fun Print(...)
@desc Write the arguments to the @ref{StdOut} stream, separated by spaces and
      followed by a line break. Flush the stream afterwards.
      <tt>Print</tt> is aimed at displaying debugging and diagnostics
      output, and Alore implementations may allow redirecting the output of
      <tt>Print</tt> to a log file or an IDE window, for example. 
      Consider using <tt>WriteLn</tt> or <tt>Write</tt> for displaying normal
      program output.
      @example
        Print(2, "and", [2, 3]) -- Display "2 and [2, 3]" (without quotes)
      @end
@end

@fun Write(...)
@desc Write the arguments to the @ref{StdOut} stream. This is a shorthand
      for <tt>io::StdOut.write</tt>.
@end
  
@fun WriteLn(...)
@desc Write the arguments to the @ref{StdOut} stream, followed by a line
      break. This is a shorthand for <tt>io::StdOut.writeLn</tt>.
@end

@fun ReadLn() as Str
@desc Read a line from @ref{StdIn}, and return the line without the line 
      ending. This is a shorthand for <tt>io::StdIn.readLn</tt>.
@end

@fun Repr(object) as Str
@desc Return a representation of the argument as a string. This is similar to
    the <tt>Str</tt> constructor, but this function may return
    more detailed information. <tt>Repr</tt> works with objects of all types.
    First try to return the result of calling the <tt>_repr</tt> method without
    arguments. If that fails, return the result of the <tt>_str</tt> method.
    If even that fails, return a generic representation of the argument that
    indicates the type of the object.
@end
  
@fun Chr(n as Int) as Str
@desc Return a single-character string with character code <tt>n</tt>.
    The valid range of values for <tt>n</tt> is from 0 to 65535, inclusive.
@end
  
@fun Ord(ch as Str) as Int
@desc Return the character code of a single-character string. The return value
     is an integer in the range from 0 to 65535, inclusive.
@end

@fun Abs(x as Int) as Int
@fun Abs(x as Float) as Float
@desc Return the absolute value of an integer or a float.
@end

@fun Min(x, y)
@desc Return the minimum of two objects.
@end

<!--
@fun Min(collection)
@desc Return the minimal object in a collection. The argument must implement
      the <tt>iterator</tt> method.
@end
-->

@fun Max(x, y)
@desc Return the maximum of two objects.
@end

<!--
@fun Max(collection)
@desc Return the maximal object in a collection. The argument must implement
      the <tt>iterator</tt> method.
@end
-->

@fun Sort(sequence[, func])
@desc Return an array that has the items of a sequence sorted in ascending
    order (by default). The optional argument specifies a function 
    that can be used for
    evaluating the order of two items. The function must accept 2 arguments
    and return a boolean indicating whether the first argument should appear
    earlier than the second argument in the sorted sequence.
@end

@fun Reversed<T>(iterable as Iterable<T>) as Array<T>
@desc Return an array that has all the items in the iterable in reverse
      order. Examples:
      @example
        Reversed([2, 3, 4])   -- [4, 3, 2]
        Reversed(0 to 3)      -- [2, 1, 0]
        Reversed("foo")       -- ["o", "o", "f"]
      @end
@end

@fun Hash(object) as Int
@desc Return the hash value of an object as an integer.
    If the object has the <tt>_hash()</tt> method, return the result of
    calling that method with no arguments. This method should return an
    integer, and all instances that compare equal should receive the same hash
    value. If the object does not have this method, calculate the hash value
    based on the identity of the object.
    <p>The main purpose of the hash value is to spread different objects in
    different slots of a <i>hash table</i> most of the time, and to collect
    equal objects in the same slots. Therefore, even though technically
    all objects of a certain type could have the same hash value, this would
    result in a dramatic slowdown of certain operations. Due to efficiency
    reasons, the optimal maximum magnitude of hash values is typically about
    2**29.
@end
  
@fun Exit([value as Int])
@desc Exit the program. The optional argument specifies an integer return value
    to the operating system. The function is implemented by raising an
    <tt>ExitException</tt>. It can be caught using a <tt>try</tt> statement
    to prevent the program from exiting.
@end

<h2>Constants</h2>

<p>This module also defines boolean constants:

@var True
@desc The boolean true value.
@end

@var False
@desc The boolean false value.
@end

<p>A few string constants are provided as well:

@var Tab
@desc The tab character (code 9).
@end

@var Newline
@desc The platform specific line break string. On Unix-like operating systems
    it is LF and on Windows CR + LF.
@end

@var LF
@desc The line feed character (code 10).
@end

@var CR
@desc The carriage return character (code 13).
@end

<h2>Exceptions</h2>

<p>The exception classes in the <tt>std</tt> module form this inheritance
hierarchy:

<ul>
  <li><tt>Exception</tt>
    <ul type=disc>
      <li><tt>ValueError</tt>
        <ul type=disc>
        <li><tt>TypeError</tt>
        <li><tt>MemberError</tt>
        <li><tt>ArithmeticError</tt>
        <li><tt>IndexError</tt>
        <li><tt>KeyError</tt>
        <li><tt>CastError</tt>
        </ul>
      <li><tt>ResourceError</tt>
        <ul type=disc>
        <li><tt>MemoryError</tt>
        </ul>
      <li><tt>RuntimeError</tt>
      <li><tt>InterruptException</tt>
      <li><tt>ExitException</tt>
      <li><tt>IoError</tt>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Simple exceptions</h3>

<p>These exception classes have similar functionality inherited from
<tt>Exception</tt>:

@class Exception([message as Str])
@desc The base class of all exceptions. <tt>Exception</tt> has a single
      member, 
      <tt>message</tt>, that contains the error message argument given to the 
      constructor, or <tt>nil</tt> if the message argument was omitted or if
      it was <tt>nil</tt>.
@end

@class ValueError([message as Str])
@desc Raised when the input values of an operation or a function have invalid
    types or values. Typically, <tt>ValueError</tt> signifies a programming 
    error, but
    it can be caught to recover from these situations. The several subclasses
    of <tt>ValueError</tt> indicate more specific conditions.
@end
    
@class TypeError([message as Str])
@desc Raised when the inputs of an operation or a function have unsupported
    types. Note that <tt>MemberError</tt> will be often raised in similar 
    situations.
@end

@class MemberError([message as Str])
@desc Raised when an object does not have a requested member or the member
    being assigned to cannot be modified.
@end

@class ArithmeticError([message as Str])
@desc Raised when an arithmetic operation or function receives invalid inputs.
    A typical example is division by zero.
@end

@class IndexError([message as Str])
@desc Raised when the index of a sequence object such as an array is out of
    bounds or otherwise invalid.
@end

@class KeyError([message as Str])
@desc Raised when a key of a mapping object is not present or is otherwise
      invalid.
@end

@class CastError([message as Str])
@desc Raised when a cast operation fails.
@end

@class ResourceError([message as Str])
@desc Raised when a resource is exhausted. This exception can be triggered by
    lack of disk space or by too many open files, for example.
@end

@class MemoryError([message as Str])
@desc Raised when a memory allocation request cannot be fulfilled. This
    exception may also be raised if only a specific kind of memory pool is
    exhausted, even though there might be memory available for other purposes.
@end

@class RuntimeError([message as Str])
@desc Raised when there is a run-time error during execution that does not have
      a more specific exception class.
@end

@class InterruptException([message as Str])
@desc Raised when the user interrupts the program by pressing Ctrl+C.
@end

<h3><tt>ExitException</tt></h3>

@class ExitException(code as Int)
@desc Raised by the <tt>std::Exit</tt> function. The argument specifies the 
      integer return value reported to the operating system. 
@end

<h3><tt>IoError</tt></h3>

@class IoError([message as Str[, error as Constant]])
@desc Raised as a response to an operating system error. This
      exception can be raised by several modules such as @ref{io} and @ref{os}.
      Typical reasons
      for raising an <tt>IoError</tt> include a missing file or directory,
      insufficient access rights to a resource and insufficient
      free space on a device. The optional <tt>error</tt> argument describes
      the reason for the error. It can be an integer <tt>errno</tt> value or a
      symbolic constant.
      @see The @ref{errno} module defines symbolic constants that can be used
           to represent errors, and provides conversions between them and
           integer <tt>errno</tt> values.
      @end
@end

<p><tt>IoError</tt> also has the following member constants:

@var code as Constant
@desc The symbolic constant representing the error. If an integer value was
      passed to the constructor, <tt>IoError</tt> tries to map the integer
      to a symbolic constant using the @ref{errno} module; failing that, or
      if the <tt>error</tt> argument was not present, the
      value is <tt>nil</tt>.
@end

@var errno as Int
@desc The integer <tt>errno</tt> value representing the error. If a symbolic
      constant was passed to the constructor, <tt>IoError</tt> tries to map the
      constant to an integer value using the @ref{errno} module; failing that,
      or if the <tt>error</tt> argument was not present, the value is 0.
@end

@end-class
