@title Regular expression matching details

<p>This section contains additional technical details of regular
expression matching.

<h2>Repetition and match length</h2>

<p>The repetition expressions *, +, ? and {} match by default a
<i>locally maximal</i> match. Each repeated expression matches the longest
possible substring in isolation, but the whole expression does not always match
the longest possible match. The regular expression is matched sequentially from
left (start) to right, each subexpression matching a locally maximal substring
so that the rest of the regular expression matches as well. The first
successful found match is always reported. The alternation operator | is
evaluated in a similar fashion: if the whole expression matches after
trying the first alternative, the second alternative is not tried at all.

<p>For example, the regular expression <tt>a?(b|abc)</tt> matches <tt>ab</tt>,
not <tt>abc</tt>, when matched against the string <tt>abc</tt>.

<h2>Minimizing repetition</h2>

<p>If a repetition expression is followed by ?, it matches a <i>locally
minimal</i> match, i.e. the smallest number of repetitions so that the rest
of the regular expression matches.

<p>For example, the regular expression <tt>.*?b+</tt> matches the string
<tt>ab</tt> when matched against the string <tt>ababb</tt>.

<h2>Grouping and back references</h2>

<p>Each parenthesized subexpression forms a grouped regular expression, or simply
a group. The substrings matched by groups can be queried using the match object
methods and they can be referred to later in the regular expression using back
references of the form \1, \2, etc. Only
the first 9 groups can be matched as back references.

<p>A back reference matches the string that was last matched by the group.
If a group is repeated, each repetition is considered a separate match.
If
the group has not matched anything, a back reference fails to match anything.

<p>For example, the regular expression <tt>(a|b)+\1</tt> matches any number
of <tt>a</tt>'s and <tt>b</tt>'s followed by <tt>aa</tt> or <tt>bb</tt>.

<h2>Precedence</h2>

<p>The alternation operator <tt>|</tt> has the lowest precedence, followed by
the concatenation operator. Repetition has the highest precedence. Use grouping
to override the operator precedence.

<p>For example, <tt>a|bc*</tt> is interpreted as <tt>a|(b(c*))</tt> (except
for grouping behavior).

<h2>Character class syntax</h2>

<p>The right square bracket (<tt>]</tt>) and dash (<tt>-</tt>)
have special meanings within character
classes (<tt>[...]</tt> or <tt>[^...]</tt>). Therefore they usually have to be
escaped using a backslash to have them interpreted literally. As an
exception, the right square bracket can be included without
escaping as the first
character of a character class, and the dash does not need to be escaped as
the first character of a character class, as the first character after a
character range and before the right square bracket.

<p>The following regular expressions have examples of these special cases:

<table class="no-border">
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[]]</tt>
    <td>match right square bracket
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[0-]</tt>
    <td>match 0 or -
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[-]</tt>
    <td>match dash
  <tr>
    <td><tt>[a-c-e]</tt>
    <td>match a, b, c, e or dash
</table>

<h2>Technical limitations</h2>

<p>The maximum regular expression length is limited to approximately 16000
characters. The regular expression matching engine uses backtracking to handle
repetition and alternation, so that matching requires exponential time in
the worst case. In general, the more complex an expression is, the longer time
the matching will take. This is different from regular expression matching
based on a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata).
