@h2 Values and objects

<p>Values are a primitive building block of Alore programs. A value is a
reference to an object, i.e. it names a single object. A value always refers to
an object &#8212; there is no notion of empty values. Alore programs can
access objects only through values: an object is only visible to the program if
there is a value that refers to it. Any number of values may refer to the same 
object.

<p>Each instance of a variable is represented by a single value. Objects
typically contain values as well. A <tt>Pair</tt> object, for
example, 
contains two values. Not all objects are composite objects. An integer object, 
for example, is not a composite object.

@h2 Objects and types

<p>All data processed by an Alore program is stored in objects or referenced
by objects. Each object has a specific type that is constant across the 
life-time of the object, and usually some <i>state</i>, that may be mutable 
or immutable (constant). The state of an object differentiates the object
from other objects of the same type. All types are represented by objects as
well.

<p>The type of <tt>nil</tt> is the only exception: it does not have a
type object
associated with it. The <tt>nil</tt> object behaves otherwise like
a @ref{std::Constant} object and supports the same operations.

<p>For example, the type of the object 15 is @ref{std::Int} and its state is
the value fifteen. This object, like all integers, is immutable. Therefore the 
object 15 cannot be modified to value 7 (or any other value).

<p>In contrast, the
type of the object <tt>[1, 2]</tt> is @ref{std::Array} and its state is
composed of its length (2) and two references to <tt>Int</tt> objects 
(1 and 2). Array objects are mutable: their length and the objects they contain
can be changed, but only by using the methods provided by the <tt>Array</tt>
type.

@h2 Types

<p>Each type is represented by a class. Classes and types are sometimes used
as synonyms, but note that a type may also refer to all subclasses of the
related class.

<p>Objects that have the class X as their type may be referred to in several
more or less equivalent ways:

<ul>
  <li>instances of X
  <li>X objects
  <li>X instances
  <li>objects of type X (this can also refer to objects of subtypes)
</ul>

<p>Class objects have several uses:

<ul>
  <li>A class specifies the structure of all instances of the class. For 
    example,
    it specifies which methods and members are included in the public
    interface of the instances, and it also specifies their behavior.
    Additionally, it defines
    how the state of the instances is represented.
  <li>Instances of a class can (usually) be constructed by calling the class
    object.
  <li>The <tt>is</tt> operator can be used with the class object to test if a 
    object is an instance of the class or any subclass of the class.
</ul>

<p>Classes can also be <i>inherited</i> from to form subtypes.
A subclass inherits
the behavior of its <i>superclass</i>, but it may add or override some
functionality.

<p>The following types are called <i>primitive types</i>: @ref{Int}, @ref{Str},
@ref{Float}, @ref{Boolean}, @ref{Type}, @ref{Function}, @ref{Constant},
@ref{Tuple}, @ref{Pair} and
@ref{Range}. They are all defined in the @ref{std} module, and they cannot
be superclasses of other classes. All other classes can act as superclasses.

@h2 Global definitions

<p>Global definitions include all global variables, global
constants, function definitions and class definitions in every module of a
program. Each global definition refers to a single value. Function definitions,
class definitions and uninitialized global constant definitions are
automatically initialized before the program is run. Other global definitions
refer to the <tt>nil</tt> object when the program is started.

@h2 Local variables

<p>Local variables are defined within functions or methods. New instances
of local variables are created every time a function or a method is called,
and they are garbage collected some time after they can no longer be
referenced within the invocation that defined them or any anonymous function
created during the invocation. As a special case, if a local variable is not
referenced by any anonymous function, it will be destroyed, at the latest,
when the function invocation that holds the variable is exited. Note that
only the value is destroyed; the object referred to by the value may not be
freed immediately, even if the local variable was the last reference to this
object.

<p>Each instance of a local variable is represented by a separate, independent
value.

@h2 Member variables

<p>Each class may define one or more explicit member variables (or constants).
For each explicit member variable or constant, there is a corresponding value
slot in every instance of the classes that contain the definition. A value slot
behaves like a variable, but unlike local
variables and global definitions, member value slots cannot be accessed
directly, but are always accessed through <i>accessor methods</i>:
<i>getters</i> and <i>setters</i> (see
@href{Class definitions} for details).

@h2 Garbage collection

<p>The <i>root set</i> of the object graph contains global definitions,
local variables and any temporary values needed while evaluating statements.
The <i>live object set</i> contains all objects reachable from the root set.
The live object set contains

<ol>
<li>objects directly referenced by the root set
<li>all objects referenced by other objects in the live set.
</ol>

<p>All objects not within the live object set are destroyed and freed
automatically by the run-time system. It is undefined when this happens, but
the run-time should, in general, try to free them as early as possible.

<p>Other objects that can be shown not to affect the execution of a program
can be freed automatically as well.
