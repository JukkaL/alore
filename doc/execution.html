@title Execution

<p>This section gives a detailed description of the program initialization and
startup. Two important concepts related to execution, calling objects and
raising exceptions, are briefly described.
Other topics related to program execution are described later in sections
@href{Statements} and @href{Expressions}.

@h2 Initialization

<p>At the start of the program execution, all modules (including the main
module) will be initialized. During module initialization:

<ol>
  <li>All global variable and constant definitions with initializers, and
   any statements in the module are evaluated.
  <li>Initializers and statements in a single file will be evaluated in the
    order they appear
    in the file, from the start of the file to the end.
    If a module contains multiple files, these files will be initialized in an 
    arbitrary order.
    @note It may therefore be helpful to collect all
    initialized global variable and constant definitions in a module to a 
    single source file to avoid problems with different evaluation orders.
    @end
  <li>After the initialization is complete, the <tt>Main</tt> function of the 
    module is called, if it is defined. The <tt>Main</tt> function 
    is not generally given any arguments.
 </ol>
 
<p>As an exception, the <tt>Main</tt> function of the main module may take a 
single argument that will receive the command line arguments given to the 
program as an array of strings. The <tt>Main</tt> function is always optional.

@h2 Module dependencies

<p>A module <i>x</i> depends on module <i>y</i> if

<ol>
  <li>module <i>x</i> imports module <i>y</i>, or
  <li>any module imported by module <i>x</i> depends on module <i>y</i>.
</ol>

<p>This definition is used in the next section.

@h2 Order of initialization

<p>The order of module initialization is not fully specified, but it must
follow these constraints:

<ol>
  <li>If module <i>x</i> depends on module <i>y</i> but module <i>y</i> does 
    not depend on module <i>x</i>,
    module <i>y</i> will be initialized before module <i>x</i>.
  <li>Initialization of multiple modules cannot be interleaved, i.e. a single
    module must first be fully initialized before another module can be 
    initialized.
</ol>

<p>In practice, these rules mean that all imported modules will be initialized
before the module that imports them, unless there are circular dependency 
chains.
The main module will be initialized last (and thus the <tt>Main</tt> function 
of the main source file will be run last after all modules have been 
initialized).

@h2 Calling objects

<p>Functions, methods and types may be called implicitly or explicitly.
Explicit calls are performed using @hrefl{Call expressions}. Implicit calls
include these:

<ul>
  <li>calling module <tt>Main</tt> functions during initialization
  <li>calling methods when evaluating many operators in expressions
  <li>calling a getter method when evaluating a member reference
  <li>calling a setter method when assigning to a member
  <li>calling the <tt>_set</tt> method when a subscript expression is used
    as an lvalue in an assignment statement
  <li>calling the <tt>create</tt> method during object construction
  <li>calling the <tt>hasNext</tt> and <tt>next</tt> methods in for loops
  <li>calling type constructors when built-in exceptions such as
    @ref{std::TypeError} are raised implicitly during evaluation.  
</ul>

<p>Both implicit and explicit calls are evaluated in the same fashion.
The rest of this section only deals with function calls, but the same rules
apply to method and type calls.

<p>A function call involves creating a new <i>invocation</i> of the
function. The invocation contains instances of any local variables and
other state needed during the evaluation of the function. Multiple invocations
of the same function can be alive at the same time, and their contents are
independent of each other.

<p>Function invocations form a stack: as a function is called, the new
invocation is pushed to the top of the stack and the previous function calls
remain inactive in the stack below the new invocation and only become active
when the new invocation returns or propagates an exception, causing that
invocation to be destroyed. The implementation may limit the maximum depth of
the call stack.

<p>An invocation may return by finishing the evaluation of the function
<i>body</i> or by evaluating a return statement within the body. In the
latter case, the invocation may optionally return a value as the result of the
function call. The caller may use or discard the return value.

<p>The bottom of the call stack contains a special invocation that is not
associated with any defined function. It is used
to evaluate the initialization expressions of global variables and constants
and to call the <tt>Main</tt> functions. After all the modules in a program
have been initialized, this invocation causes the program execution to end.

@h2 Raising exceptions

<p>As their name implies, exceptions are raised in response to exceptional
conditions. They may be raised by many operations in
the language. The programmer can
also raise them explicitly with the @hrefl{Raise statement}.

<p>Each exception is associated with an exception object whose type must be
@ref{std::Exception} or its subtype.

<p>When an exception is raised, the evaluation of the current expression or
statement is terminated. Any try blocks enclosing the current location in
code are consulted, starting from the innermost one and proceeding outwards
(see section @href{Try statement} for details).

<p>If no try statement in the current function or method catches the exception,
it is <i>propagated</i> to the next invocation in the call stack. The exception
acts as if it was raised in the call statement that was being evaluated in the
function. This process is continued until the exception is caught or until
the call stack becomes empty, in which case the program is terminated due to
an uncaught exception.
