@title <tt>io</tt>: Basic file access

<p>This module provides facilities for reading, creating, and writing files.
The <tt>Stream</tt> class is also used as a base class for other file-like
objects such as network connections.

<p>Streams support both character and line based input and output. All of
the following line endings are accepted when reading lines:

<ul>
  <li>CR (carriage return, decimal code 13)
  <li>LF (line feed, decimal code 10)
  <li>CR+LF
</ul>

<p>Line based output uses the native line ending of the platform
(CR+LF on Windows, LF on Unix-like operating systems).

<p>All file operations and some stream operations may raise a
@ref{std::IoError} exception.

@see The module @ref{encodings} defines several useful text file encodings that
     can be used with @ref{TextStream} and @ref{TextFile} classes.

<h2>Stream classes</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><b>
    @link io_stream.html
    </b>
  <dd>This is the abstract base class of all stream classes defined in this
    module.
  <dt><b>
    @link io_file.html
    </b>
  <dd>This class represents open files using raw access, i.e. no character
    set conversion.
  <dt><b>
    @link io_textstream.html
    </b>
  <dd>This class can be used to wrap around raw streams to provide
    transparent character set conversion when reading or writing.
  <dt><b>
    @link io_textfile.html
    </b>
  <dd>This class represents open text files with a particular character
    encoding.

<h2>Standard streams</h2>

<p>The following constants refer to standard streams. They are available as
text stream objects using the platform default encoding:

@var StdIn as TextStream
@desc The standard input stream.
@end

@var StdOut as TextStream
@desc The standard output stream. This stream will be line buffered if
      connected to a terminal, and buffered otherwise.
@end

@var StdErr as TextStream
@desc The standard error stream. This stream is always unbuffered.
@end

<p>The standard streams are also available as raw 8-bit streams:
  
@var RawStdIn as File
@var RawStdOut as File
@var RawStdErr as File
@desc Raw standard streams. The buffering mode is the same as with
      corresponding non-raw streams.
@end

<h2>Stream options</h2>

<p>Several options can be used with <tt>Stream</tt> and <tt>File</tt>
constructors. They are all symbolic constants:

@var Input as Constant
@desc Stream option for reading.
@end
  
@var Output as Constant
@desc Stream option for writing.
@end
  
@var Append as Constant
@desc <tt>File</tt> option for opening a file for writing. The existing 
      file contents will be kept and the file pointer will be moved to the end 
      of the file when the file is opened.
@end

@var Unbuffered as Constant
@desc Stream option for unbuffered access. The stream will be automatically
      flushed after every output operation and the use of an input buffer is
      minimized.
@end
  
@var LineBuffered as Constant
@desc Stream option for line buffered access. The stream will be
      automatically flushed after writing a line break. The output and input
      buffer sizes will be small.
@end

@var Buffered as Constant
@desc Stream option for fully buffered access. All stream input and output
      operations will be buffered. The <tt>flush</tt>
      method (or the <tt>close</tt> method) must be
      called after a set of write operations.
@end

@var Narrow as Constant
@desc Stream option for creating a <i>narrow stream</i>. Narrow streams 
      only process 8-bit (narrow) strings, i.e. strings with no character codes
      larger than 255.
@end

@var Protected as Constant
@desc File option for creating a file that can only be accessed by the current
      user.
@end

<h2>Default encoding</h2>
  
<p>The platform default encoding class:

@var DefaultEncoding as encodings::Encoding
@desc The default system text encoding. Its value depends on the current
      locale settings and the operating system. This object implements the
      @href{Character encoding interface} described in the @ref{encodings}
      module.
@end
