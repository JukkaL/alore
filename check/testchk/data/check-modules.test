-- Test cases for the type checker.
--
-- Each test case consists of at least two sections.
-- The first section contains [case NAME] followed by the input code, while
-- the second section contains [out] followed by the output from the parser.
--
-- Lines starting with "--" in this file will be ignored, except for lines
-- starting with "----" that are not ignored. The first two dashes of these
-- lines are interpreted as escapes and removed.
