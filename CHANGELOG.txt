Alore ChangeLog
===============

0.6.0 (January 2011)

 * Use "def" keyword instead "sub" to define functions.

   "sub" is still supported as an alternative for compatibility with
   earlier Alore versions, but it will be dropped in a future Alore
   release. This may break existing programs that use "def" as an
   identifier.

 * Renamed the C API macros A_SUB* to A_DEF*. Existing C modules have to
   be updated.

 * Added the std::Tuple type.

   The expression e1, ..., eN now constructs a Tuple object instead of an
   Array. This may break existing programs. To preserve existing
   behavior, surround all Array expressions with square brackets.

 * Added several features in preparation for the upcoming optional type
   system.

   These are of limited use in dynamically-typed programs. Some existing
   programs may be broken due to the addition of new keywords.

   The documentation of these new features is still incomplete.

   * Added interfaces and bind declarations.
   * Added cast expressions, including the dynamic cast expression.
   * Added std::CastError.
   * Accept and ignore optional type annotations in the parser without
     parsing or validating them.
   * Added 4 new keywords: "interface", "implements", "bind" and
     "dynamic".
   * The ":" token is used for both Pair expressions and for delimiting
     type annotations. Pair expression must be within parentheses or
     square brackets to disambiguate them from type annotations.
   * The lexer and parser process ">" tokens slightly differently. This
     should not affect valid existing programs.
   * Added the C API macros A_INTERFACE, A_END_INTERFACE and A_IMPLEMENTS
     for defining and implementing interfaces.
   * Added interfaces std::Iterable, std::Iterator, std::Sequence,
     std::Comparable, std::Addable and std::Multipliable. Several
     standard library types implement some of these.

 * Made re::MatchResult public so that it can be referred to in type
   declarations.

 * Fixed a few parser bugs.

0.5.0 (October 2010)

 * First Alore release in wide distribution.
