Alore Demo Programs
===================


Introduction
------------

The subdirectories of demo/ contain several example Alore programs that
illustrate different features of the language and the standard library.

Have a look at the README files in the subdirectories and the comments in each
source file for additional instructions.

Note that many of the examples do not do proper error checking to better
illustrate core concepts.

The examples include both dynamically-typed and statically-types programs.

Unlike the rest of the Alore distribution, the examples are relased to the
public domain, unless otherwise mentioned in the source files.
